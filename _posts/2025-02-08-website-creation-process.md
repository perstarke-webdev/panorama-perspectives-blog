## **Introduction**

I’ve been building websites for a while now, and recently, I’ve been focusing on growing my business—helping more clients bring their visions to life in a **stress-free, smooth, and enjoyable way**. But beyond just delivering great websites, I’ve put a lot of thought into **how I can make my clients even happier**—how I can make them feel truly valued, supported, and confident throughout the process.

For me, **a great process matters just as much as the final website itself**. It’s not just about finishing projects—it’s about making sure every client feels **taken care of, understood, and excited** about their new website. A big part of how I achieve this is through my **routines and checklists**, which allow me to stay efficient while ensuring **no detail gets overlooked**.

In this post, I’ll take you behind the scenes and share my **step-by-step website creation process**—from the first client conversation to launch and beyond. Whether you’re a freelancer looking to **streamline your workflow** or just curious about what goes into creating a website with **care and precision**, I hope this gives you some valuable insights! 🚀

## **Step 1: The Check-In & Gathering Info**

The first step in every project is **onboarding the client smoothly and ensuring they feel confident about the process**. Some clients come in with a clear vision, while others need more guidance—I adjust to their needs so they feel comfortable and excited about the journey ahead.

### **Adapting to Each Client’s Workflow**

Every client is different, so I make sure to **communicate in the way that works best for them**:

✅ Some prefer **structured calls** where we discuss everything in detail.  
✅ Others like to **write everything out via email or WhatsApp**.  
✅ Some already have **a clear plan**, while others need **more guidance** to figure things out.

If a client has **a well-thought-out idea**, I let them take the lead, simply asking questions for clarification where needed. But if they’re unsure, I guide them through the process usually using **my [Homepage Canvas](https://perstarke-webdev.de/canvas)**—a structured framework of key questions that helps them define what they need for their website.

### **Making Sure Everything is Clear**

From the very beginning, I ensure that:

✔️ **Pricing and payment structure** are well communicated.  
✔️ **The website creation process** is outlined so there are no surprises.  
✔️ **The client knows what to expect** at every stage—from gathering details to the draft, revisions, and launch.

I often refer clients to my **[Customer Journey page](https://perstarke-webdev.de/en/customer-journey)** for an in-depth look at the full process, but I also make sure to explain the key steps personally.

### **Checklist: Gathering All Required Information**

To keep things structured while adapting to each client’s needs, I go through the following steps:

📌 **Add new client to my CRM** (for me, a detailed Google Docs works best for now, but might change that in the future) when a strong interest or a closed sale is indicated.  
📌 **Discuss payment structure** (~50% upfront, 50% after finishing, with my 90-day satisfaction and money-back guarantee).  
📌 **Gather all necessary information**, taking notes in a client file I create on Apple Notes.  
📌 **Check for missing details** and request anything that’s unclear.  
📌 **Ensure all requirements are clearly communicated and agreed upon**.

📝 **Typical information I collect includes:**  
🔹 One-pager or multi-pager  
🔹 Website structure & content  
🔹 Design preferences  
🔹 Texts, images & logo  
🔹 Social media links  
🔹 Domain details & imprint information  
🔹 Any specific services or functionalities needed

### **Why This Step Matters**

A website project should never feel stressful or confusing for the client. By **setting everything up properly from the start**, I make sure they feel **organized, excited, and fully aware of what’s happening next**—and that I have everything I need to start building with **clarity and confidence**. 🚀


## **Step 2: Creating the Website**

Once I have all the details from the client, it’s time to **bring their vision to life**. While every website is different, I follow a structured process to ensure efficiency **without sacrificing quality or attention to detail**.

For most of my projects—especially my **standard websites**, which are simpler, cost-effective projects that are partly made via templates yet still personalized—I use [**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/) as my go-to framework. However, for **more complex projects** (like e-commerce stores, admin dashboards, or interactive platforms), I adapt my workflow to fit the project’s needs. While I don’t yet have a full checklist for these advanced projects, I am actively refining my process as I take on more of them.

This stage is about **more than just making a site work**—it’s about making sure it looks great, performs well, and is a joy to use **before the client even sees it**.

### **Why a Structured Approach Matters**

I aim for **both consistency and flexibility**—which means balancing structured steps with the unique needs of each client. My process ensures:

✔️ A smooth and **efficient** website build.  
✔️ A design that **matches the client’s vision** while maintaining best practices.  
✔️ A **fully responsive, fast, and user-friendly** experience right from the start.


### **Step 2.1: Setting the Foundation**

Before writing a single line of custom code, I make sure the project is **set up properly**:

📌 **Set project status in CRM** to “Website in Creation.”  
📌 **Select the right Jekyll theme** (often [**OneFlow**](https://oneflow-jekyll-theme.github.io/), which is a theme I build myself, or [**Minimal Mistakes**](https://oneflow-jekyll-theme.github.io/), which was the base-theme I used for building OneFlow - but sometimes more custom solutions).  
📌 **Create a GitHub repo** in my organization and clone it locally.  
📌 **Set up basic files** – deleting placeholders, updating the ReadMe, and adjusting the configuration settings.

At this point, the site **exists**—but it's still a blank canvas waiting for content and personalization.


### **Step 2.2: Structuring & Styling the Website**

Once the technical setup is done, I start making it **look and feel like the client’s brand**. This includes:

🎨 **Color Scheme & Branding**  
✅ Extracting the key colors (background, text, accents).  
✅ Applying them across the **backgrounds, texts, navigation, buttons, links, and footer**.

📂 **Website Structure**  
✅ Setting up **navigation, subpages, and sections**.  
✅ Ensuring a **logical layout** that makes information easy to find.

🖼️ **Visuals & Design Elements**  
✅ Adding **logo & favicon** (generated via [**RealFaviconGenerator**](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)).  
✅ Choosing **hero images** or creating a **header design** that matches the brand.  
✅ Deciding on **additional effects** (e.g., parallax scrolling).

📌 If the client has **specific design requests**—like unique navigation styles, analytics integration, or special font selections—I add them at this stage.


### **Step 2.3: Adding Content & Ensuring Usability**

With the foundation in place, I focus on **what really makes a website work**—the content and user experience.

📄 **Filling in Content**  
✅ Adding **texts, images, buttons, and galleries**.  
✅ Making sure everything is **structured and visually appealing**.

🔗 **Checking Functionality**  
✅ Ensuring all **links & buttons work correctly**.  
✅ Testing **contact forms** (if applicable).

📱 **Mobile Responsiveness**  
✅ Using [**Responsinator**](http://www.responsinator.com/) to check how the site looks on **different devices**.  
✅ Fixing **any layout issues** before the client even sees the first draft.

By the end of this step, the **draft website is fully functional and polished**—even before feedback and revisions.


### **Step 2.4: Internal Review & First Deployment**

Before sending the website to the client, I do **one last internal check**:

📌 **Run a full quality check** on desktop & mobile.  
📌 **Fix any outstanding GitHub issues that I wrote for myself during the creation**.  
📌 **Deploy a private draft version (usually via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/))** with a **noindex meta tag** (so it’s not visible to search engines).  
📌 **Review on real devices** (mobile, Chrome, Safari, and Firefox).

Once everything looks great, I’m ready for **Step 3: Client Review & Revisions**! 🚀


## **Step 3: The Revision Phase—Client Collaboration & Feedback**

Once the first draft is ready, the **real collaboration begins**. This phase is about more than just "fixing things"—it’s about **ensuring the client feels heard, involved, and excited** about their website coming to life.

Some clients have **clear, structured feedback**, while others feel unsure about what to change. My job is to make **the revision process easy, stress-free, and effective**—whether that means detailed change requests or just a quick call to discuss adjustments.

I never rush this step. The goal? **A website the client truly loves.**


### **Step 3.1: Sending the First Draft & Encouraging Thoughtful Feedback**

Once the **draft site is published**, I:

📌 **Update the CRM** status to "Website in Revision."  
📌 **Send the client the live draft**—this isn’t a half-finished site, but a **fully working version** (still hidden from search engines).  
📌 **Make giving feedback easy**—I ask if they prefer:
- A **detailed written review** with comments.
- A **quick call** to talk through their thoughts.
- A mix of both—whatever works best for them.

📌 **Include a small personal touch**—
- I might send a behind-the-scenes photo of my workspace while working on their site.
- Or a short message about how I enjoyed building their site so far.
- The little things that **make them smile** and remind them their project is important to me.


### **Step 3.2: Making Revisions Based on Client Input**

Once I gather the client’s feedback, I:

📌 **Document all changes** in their client note.  
📌 **Offer suggestions when needed**—if a requested change might hurt usability or design, I **explain why and suggest alternatives**.  
📌 **Execute changes in the main repo**, ensuring all updates are clean and structured.  
📌 **Push the revised version live** on their private draft site (again, keeping it hidden from search engines).  
📌 **Send the update to the client**
📌 **Repeat as needed**—I revise the site **as many times as necessary** until the client is **100% happy**.


### **Step 3.3: Final Checks Before Moving to Launch**

Before we move to **Step 4: The Final Launch**, I do one last internal check:

📌 Ensure **all GitHub issues are resolved**.  
📌 Review the  **final version** on desktop & mobile.  
📌 Check [**pagespeed results**](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) to ensure all best practices and speed requirements are met.   
📌 Confirm with the client that **they love the result**.

Once everything is **approved and ready**, we move on to **launching the website! 🚀**



## **Step 4: The Launch & Making Clients Smile**

The **final launch** is about making sure **everything runs smoothly**, clients feel **supported**, and the experience ends on a **high note**.

For many clients, launching a website is **a big deal**—so I always try to make it **as exciting, stress-free, and memorable as possible**.


### **Step 4.1: Helping with the Domain Setup**

For some clients, **domain & hosting setup can feel overwhelming**, so I make this as easy as possible:

📌 If they **already own a domain**, I:
- Offer to handle the launch myself if they send over login details.
- Or **guide them step-by-step** if they prefer to do it themselves.

📌 If they **don’t have a domain yet**, I:
- Help them **choose a good one** (short, clear, and easy to remember).
- If they booked the package with domain setup, I **reserve & configure it for them**.

I **never just send a generic tutorial**—I personally walk them through the process, so they feel **confident and supported**.


### **Step 4.2: The Launch & Making It Special**

Once everything is ready, it’s time to **go live!** 🚀

🎉 Send a **celebration message**—"Your website is LIVE!"   
📸 Share a **fun GIF or site preview**—to make the moment feel special.  
💌 Include a **personal touch**—a quick note about how I enjoyed working on their project.

Even though the project is "finished," I always remind them:  
💡 **I’m still here for any questions** and happy to support them moving forward.


### **Step 4.3: Wrapping Up & Staying Connected**

After the site is live, I:

📌 **Send the final invoice** (always at least **one day after launch**—no rush!).  
📌 **Write & send a thank-you card** 💌—because a little personal touch goes a long way.  
📌 **Ask if I can add their site to my references and share it on Instagram.**  
📌 **If they agree, add it to references and create + schedule the post celebrating their new website!** 🚀

Just because the project is done doesn’t mean **the relationship is over**—I make sure every client knows that I’m still there if they ever need help.

**The goal?**  
A smooth, stress-free launch—and a **client who’s happy not just with their website, but with the whole experience.**


## **Step 5: After Launch – Ongoing Support & 3-Month Check-Ins**

Just because a website is launched **doesn’t mean my job is over**. I want my clients to feel supported long after their site goes live—so I **always follow up** to check in, offer help, and ensure everything is still working smoothly.


### **Step 5.1: The 3-Month Check-In**

Every project gets a **3-month follow-up** in my calendar. This is my way of **staying connected** and making sure clients still feel confident with their website.

📅 **What I do at the 3-month mark:**  
✔️ Review our **last conversations** to see if anything was left open.  
✔️ Check my **client notes** for anything specific they might need.  
✔️ **Reach out personally** to ask if everything is running smoothly or if they have any questions.

If updates, fixes, or improvements come up, I **act on them right away** and set a **new check-in date** for the future.

💡 **Bonus:** If the timing feels right, I might also ask if they know anyone who could benefit from my services—referrals are a great way to keep growing my business while keeping it personal.


### **Step 5.2: Website Updates & Future Improvements**

Websites **aren’t static**—businesses grow, needs evolve, and things change. That’s why I make **updates & improvements** as easy as possible.

When a client needs changes, I:

📌 **Gather feedback**—via call, WhatsApp, email, or whatever works best for them.  
📌 **Document changes**—so nothing gets lost or forgotten.  
📌 **Update the website**—either directly or, for bigger updates, in a **draft version first**.  
📌 **Test everything thoroughly** before deploying.

Once the client is **100% happy**, I:  
✔️ **Deploy the update** 🚀  
✔️ Send an **update invoice** (if applicable)  
✔️ Set a **new check-in date** if it makes sense

No matter if it’s a **small tweak** or a **big redesign**, I always want my clients to know: **I’m here to support them whenever they need.**


## **Final Thoughts: My Goal is Happy Clients, Not Just Finished Projects**

At the end of the day, **a great website is about more than just clean code and a good design**—it’s about giving clients a **smooth, stress-free experience** where they feel **supported, valued, and excited** about their new online presence.

✅ That’s why I take time to **listen, adapt, and personalize** my process for every client.  
✅ That’s why I focus on **clear communication**—so there’s no confusion or stress.  
✅ And that’s why I **don’t disappear after the launch**—because ongoing support matters.

If you’re a **freelancer or web designer**, I hope this post gives you some insights into **how a structured process can help you work efficiently while still making every client feel special**. And if you’re a **business owner looking for a website**, I hope this gives you a **peek behind the scenes** of how I work.

At the end of the day, it’s about **building relationships** and making sure every client walks away feeling **happy and taken care of**, not just about finishing projects. 🚀💙
