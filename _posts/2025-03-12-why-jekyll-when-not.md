## Introduction

When I started my web development business, Jekyll was my tool of choice. I wanted a way to build fast, secure, and customizable websites without unnecessary complexity. Over the past few yearsâ€”especially in the last 15 monthsâ€”things have taken off. Iâ€™ve worked with over 30 clients across different industries, refining my workflow and testing different tools along the way.

Through all of that, Jekyll has remained one of my go-to solutions. It helps me streamline my development process, deliver affordable, high-performance websites, and create custom designs without bloated platforms.

That said, Jekyll isnâ€™t always the right choice. Some projects require more dynamic features, and in those cases, I turn to other tools.

In this post, Iâ€™ll share:

- Why I use Jekyll for many client projects
- When itâ€™s the best choiceâ€”and when itâ€™s not
- How it fits into my web development workflow

If you're a business owner, freelancer, or developer looking for cost-effective, high-performance websites, this guide will help you understand when Jekyll makes senseâ€”and when to use something else.

## A Quick Detour: What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a tool that builds websites as simple, static files instead of relying on a database-driven system like WordPress. Instead of generating pages dynamically on each visit, Jekyll pre-builds the entire site in advance, turning content written in Markdown, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a fully functional website that is fast, secure, and easy to host.

Originally created for GitHub Pages, Jekyll works well with Git, a version control and collaboration tool widely used in IT projects, making it easy to update and deploy changes. Itâ€™s built with Ruby and uses Liquid templates to create reusable layouts and dynamic content without needing a backend.

Since everything is pre-built before the site goes live, Jekyll sites load quickly, work well with content delivery networks for global performance, and donâ€™t require ongoing maintenance. Jekyll sites can be hosted for free on platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, and Vercel, keeping costs low.

## Why Jekyll Is My Go-To for Many Projects

### Free, Cost-Effective Hosting

One of the biggest advantages of Jekyll is that it eliminates ongoing hosting costs. Websites built with Jekyll can be hosted for free on platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel, meaning clients only need to pay for a domain. There are no monthly platform fees like with WordPress, Webflow, or other hosted solutions, and no maintenance costs for server updates or security patches.

For smaller businesses, freelancers, or individuals with limited budgets, this has been a game-changer. Many of my clients were expecting ongoing fees for hosting and CMS subscriptions, and they were extremely happy to realize that their website could run at zero cost. This has been especially valuable for those just starting out, where every dollar saved matters.

While Iâ€™m expanding into working with larger businesses as well, affordability remains a key factor for many of my clients. Jekyll allows me to offer high-quality websites without locking them into expensive long-term costs.

### Speed & Performance

Jekyllâ€™s biggest advantage in performance comes from the fact that it pre-generates every page as static HTML. Unlike database-driven websites that build pages dynamically each time a visitor loads them, Jekyll sites are already fully rendered and ready to go. This means:

- **Ultra-fast load times** â€“ Since thereâ€™s no database to query or backend logic to process, pages load almost instantly.
- **Better SEO** â€“ Google favors fast websites, and speed directly impacts search rankings. A Jekyll site has a natural advantage over heavier platforms that rely on real-time content generation.
- **Lower server load** â€“ With fewer moving parts, Jekyll sites can handle high traffic effortlessly. Thereâ€™s no need for caching plugins or performance optimizations just to keep the site running smoothly.
- **Seamless CDN integration** â€“ Jekyll sites work well with content delivery networks (CDNs), ensuring fast load times worldwide. Since the site is already static, distributing it across global servers is simple and highly effective.

For clients, this speed boost means a better user experience, higher engagement, and in many cases, better conversion rates. A slow-loading website can drive visitors away, while a snappy, responsive one helps keep them engaged.


### Security & Reliability

One of the biggest risks with database-driven websites is security. Platforms like WordPress rely on a backend, user authentication, and third-party pluginsâ€”all of which can introduce vulnerabilities if not properly maintained. Jekyll, on the other hand, removes many of these risks by eliminating the need for a database or server-side processing.

- **Fewer security risks** â€“ No database means no exposure to SQL injection attacks or unauthorized data access.
- **No server-side code** â€“ Since Jekyll sites are static, there are no exploitable backend scripts or plugin vulnerabilities.
- **Peace of mind** â€“ No need for constant security patches, reducing the risk of website hacks or unexpected maintenance issues.

<div class="notice--danger">
A great example of this came from a client who had his website on WordPress but ran into security issues, including data breaches. He liked the design of his site but was tired of the maintenance and security concerns.
</div>
<div class="notice--success">
I rebuilt his website in Jekyll, keeping the same look and feel, while improving responsiveness and user experience. The result? A faster, safer, and more reliable siteâ€”without the security headaches he previously dealt with.
</div>

For businesses that donâ€™t need frequent backend updates or user authentication, Jekyll offers a **simple, secure alternative** that removes many of the common risks of traditional CMS platforms.

### Full Control & Customization

Many CMS platforms offer customization, but they often come with limitationsâ€”locked-down themes, rigid templates, or complex plugin dependencies. With Jekyll, customization is straightforward because I can **edit the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript directly**. Thereâ€™s no need to work around theme restrictionsâ€”every part of the site is accessible and fully adjustable.

Jekyll also uses **Liquid**, a templating language that makes it easier to structure content dynamically. Instead of repeating the same HTML code across multiple pages, I can create **reusable components** for headers, footers, or blog post previews. Liquid allows me to insert dynamic content, loop through lists (like blog posts or project portfolios), and conditionally display elementsâ€”without needing a database or backend scripting.

<div class="notice--success">
And on a personal noteâ€”itâ€™s just more fun to write code than to drag and drop elements around. ðŸ˜†
</div>

### Efficient, Templatized Development for Affordable, High-Quality Websites

Jekyll allows for **theme-based development**, making it possible to build high-quality websites quickly while keeping costs low for clients. Themes like [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) and [OneFlow](https://oneflow-jekyll-theme.github.io/)(which is a theme I build myself and use for many projects) provide a strong foundation with pre-built components such as navigation menus, content boxes, notices, galleries, and typography styles. These reusable elements help structure the site efficiently while still allowing for complete customization.

Unlike many CMS platforms where themes can be restrictive, Jekyll gives full access to all theme files, including CSS, JavaScript, and Liquid templates. This means I can adjust everythingâ€”from layout structure to interactive elementsâ€”while still benefiting from the efficiency of a theme-based workflow. Each page can also include fully custom elements/code, making it easy to tailor the design to a clientâ€™s brand and needs.

- **Faster development with templates** â€“ By starting with a structured theme instead of coding everything from scratch, I can build websites much faster, which means lower costs for clients.
- **Affordable but custom** â€“ Clients get a well-designed, responsive website without paying for a fully custom-coded solution. The structure is efficient, but every project is still unique.
- **Easy future updates** â€“ Since the codebase is clean and modular, making changes later is simple, allowing businesses to expand their site without a full rebuild.
- **Fast turnaround without sacrificing quality** â€“ With structured themes and reusable components, I can deliver high-quality websites quickly while maintaining performance, security, and scalability.

<div class="notice--info">
This approach has been a key factor in my business success. By streamlining my development like this, I can offer affordable, high-quality websites due to the efficiency of the process.
</div>

### Ideal for Content-Centric Websites

Jekyll is an excellent choice for **content-driven websites**, whether they focus on text, images, or a mix of both. It works well for sites that need frequent updates, like blogs and documentation pages, but is also great for simple business websites that donâ€™t require constant changes.

I use Jekyll myself for my **Panorama Perspectives blog ([blog.perstarke-webdev.de](https://blog.perstarke-webdev.de/))**, built with the Minimal Mistakes theme. Writing new content is as easy as creating a Markdown file, pushing it to Git, and the website updates automatically.

For clients, this system offers several benefits:

- **Simple content management** â€“ Markdown makes formatting easy without requiring technical skills. Clients can edit or add content without touching complex HTML or code.
- **No costly CMS subscriptions** â€“ Unlike WordPress, Squarespace, or similar platforms, Jekyll doesnâ€™t require monthly fees for content management. Clients can publish content for free.
- **Great for static or frequently updated sites** â€“ Jekyll works just as well for businesses that only need a simple, well-designed site with no ongoing updates, as it does for blogs or documentation pages that require regular content changes.
- **Options for even easier editing** â€“ If a client needs a more user-friendly editing experience, I can integrate a tool like Netlify CMS, which provides a simple web-based interface for updating contentâ€”without needing direct access to the code or files.

<div class="notice--warning">
I havenâ€™t used Netlify CMS in a project yet, but Iâ€™m currently starting a new project where Iâ€™ll most likely implement it for the first timeâ€”something Iâ€™m really excited about. This will make content updates even easier for clients who prefer a non-technical interface, while still keeping the advantages of Jekyllâ€™s speed and simplicity.
</div>


### Efficient Developer Workflow

Jekyll integrates seamlessly with **Git-based version control**, making development more flexible, organized, and risk-free. Whether working solo or collaborating with another developer, Git ensures that every change is tracked and reversibleâ€”something thatâ€™s much harder to manage on platforms like WordPress or Squarespace.

- **Version control & rollbacks** â€“ There have been times, especially early on, when I experimented with a design idea and completely messed things up (if you're a developer, you know the feeling ðŸ˜†). With Git, which works perfectly with Jekyll, I can simply revert to a previous version and start fresh without losing anything.
- **Seamless collaboration** â€“ When working with other developers, Git allows us to make changes in parallel without worrying about overwriting each otherâ€™s workâ€”unlike platforms like WordPress or Squarespace, where simultaneous edits can cause conflicts.
- **Easy local development** â€“ I love deploying Jekyll in a Docker environment, allowing me to preview changes instantly on my local machine before pushing anything live. This makes testing and refining the site much faster and more reliable.
- **Preview live changes before launch** â€“ Since Jekyll builds static files, itâ€™s easy to set up test domains or local previews so clients can see the site before going live, without affecting the production version.

These features make Jekyll a **developer-friendly platform** that encourages risk-free experimentation, smooth teamwork, and a structured workflow. 



## When Jekyll Is Not the Right Choice

### When Clients Need a Fully Dynamic Website

Jekyll is great for static websites, but itâ€™s not designed for projects that require real-time interactions, user authentication, or constantly changing content. Since Jekyll pre-generates all pages as static files, it doesn't have a built-in way to handle dynamic features like:

- **User logins and authentication** â€“ No built-in system for memberships, dashboards, or personalized content.
- **Live updates** â€“ Content changes require rebuilding the site, making it impractical for things like social feeds, live stock updates, or real-time booking systems.
- **Advanced e-commerce functionality** â€“ While it's possible to integrate third-party solutions like Snipcart or Shopify Buy Button, Jekyll doesn't support a built-in shopping cart, dynamic product management, or customer accounts.

For projects that require these kinds of interactive features, I turn to other tools:

- **Next.js** â€“ Great for hybrid static/dynamic websites with React-based frontends.
- **WordPress** â€“ Still a solid choice for content-heavy sites that need plugins and user management.
- **Custom React-based solutions** â€“ Best for fully custom web applications requiring flexibility and scalability.


### When Clients Need a WYSIWYG CMS

Jekyll doesnâ€™t come with a built-in visual editor like traditional content management systems. Instead of using a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor, content updates are made using Markdown and Git. While Markdown is simple, it still requires a basic understanding of file structures and commits, which can be a challenge for non-technical clients.

- **No built-in CMS interface** â€“ Thereâ€™s no visual dashboard where clients can log in and edit content with a rich text editor.
- **Requires Markdown & Git** â€“ Content updates need to be written in Markdown and pushed via Git, which isnâ€™t always intuitive for non-developers.
- **Not ideal for frequent content updates** â€“ If a client wants to make regular changes to their website without touching code, Jekyll may not be the best choice.

For clients who need an **easy-to-use CMS**, I typically recommend:

- **Webflow** â€“ A visual builder with CMS functionality, great for clients who want full design and content control.
- **WordPress** â€“ A widely used CMS with a familiar editing interface and a large plugin ecosystem.
- **SquareSpace** â€“ A simple yet relatively powerful DIY tool.
- **Netlify CMS (or other headless CMS solutions)** â€“ A **headless CMS** provides a content management interface without being tied to a specific frontend. It allows clients to edit content in a user-friendly dashboard, while Jekyll pulls in the content during site builds. This keeps the website fast and secure while making content updates easier, and can also be used in combination with Jekyll.

### When Scaling Becomes an Issue

Jekyll works well for small to medium-sized websites, but when a project grows beyond a certain point, performance limitations can appear. Since Jekyll pre-builds every page as a static file, sites with thousands of pages or frequent updates can experience slow build times.

- **Large sites (1,000+ pages) = Slow build times** â€“ The more pages a Jekyll site has, the longer it takes to generate new versions, making publishing updates inefficient.
- **Frequent content updates require full site rebuilds** â€“ Every time content is changed, the entire site needs to be rebuilt and redeployed, which can be time-consuming for news sites or high-traffic blogs with daily updates.

For projects that require better scalability, I would consider other options:

- **Hugo** â€“ A static site generator like Jekyll but significantly faster when handling large content-heavy sites.
- **Next.js** â€“ A hybrid static/dynamic framework that allows for incremental builds, making it more efficient for websites with frequent updates.


### When Clients Want Custom Highly Complex Designs

Jekyll allows for full customization, but when it comes to highly complex or unconventional designs, it may not always be the most efficient choice. Since Jekyll relies on static HTML and templating, achieving intricate layouts, advanced animations, or highly interactive visual effects often requires manual coding and workarounds.

- **Fully custom or unconventional designs require extra effort** â€“ While Jekyll lets me edit everything at the code level, designs that deviate heavily from standard layouts (e.g., overlapping elements, dynamic transitions, or non-traditional navigation structures) often take significantly more time to implement.
- **Advanced animations and microinteractions** â€“ Jekyll doesnâ€™t come with built-in tools for animations, so everything must be coded manually using CSS or JavaScript.
- **Limited design flexibility compared to modern page builders** â€“ Platforms like Webflow allow for more visual control without requiring extensive custom CSS, making them faster for design-heavy projects.

For projects requiring extensive visual complexity, alternative tools are often a better fit:

- **React.js** â€“ A JavaScript framework ideal for highly interactive layouts, complex UI components, and web applications.
- **Webflow** â€“ A no-code/low-code design tool that makes it easy to create advanced, pixel-perfect designs and animations, great for clients who want more control without coding.

That said, Jekyll can still be extended with modern front-end tools to improve styling and interactivity while keeping the benefits of a static site:

- **Tailwind CSS** â€“ A utility-first CSS framework that speeds up custom styling by providing pre-defined classes for spacing, typography, colors, and more. This allows for rapid design iterations without writing extensive custom CSS. Tailwind integrates easily into Jekyll projects, making styling more efficient.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** â€“ A powerful JavaScript library for creating animations and motion effects. Itâ€™s widely used for smooth transitions, parallax scrolling, and interactive elements. Adding GSAP to a Jekyll project allows for dynamic animations without the need for a full JavaScript framework.

Jekyll can handle custom designs, but if a project requires extensive interactivity or unconventional layouts, modern front-end frameworks or design-focused tools are often more efficient. However, for Jekyll-based projects, Tailwind CSS and GSAP are great additions that enhance styling and animation while keeping the site lightweight and fast.




## Workarounds & Customization Strategies for Jekyll

### Making Jekyll More Client-Friendly

Jekyll is developer-friendly by default, but with some adjustments, it can also work well for clients who want to update their content without touching code. While Jekyll doesnâ€™t have a built-in CMS, there are a few strategies to make content management easier:

- **Use a headless CMS** â€“ Services like Netlify CMS, Forestry, or Contentful provide a web-based editor where clients can manage content without accessing the code directly. These tools integrate with Jekyll and allow for easier updates while keeping the site static and fast.
- **Editable sections within Jekyllâ€™s `include` folder** â€“ Instead of limiting content editing to blog posts, specific sections of a Jekyll site can be made editable using Markdown. By structuring content inside the `include` folder and referencing these files in the layout, clients can easily update **news, announcements, or other key areas** without modifying the siteâ€™s structure.
- **Guided GitHub workflow** â€“ With a short introduction to GitHubâ€™s user interface, many clients can manage basic content updates themselves. Since Jekyll works seamlessly with Git, they can edit Markdown files directly in the GitHub repository, commit changes, and see the site update automatically.

These workarounds allow clients to have more control over their content without needing a full CMS, keeping Jekyllâ€™s efficiency and simplicity while making updates more accessible.


### Customizing Jekyll Beyond Its Intended Use

Jekyll is designed for structured, template-based websites. However, some projects require more flexible, custom designsâ€”like pages with completely different hero sections, alternate footers, special landing pages without navigation, or multilingual setups. While these features aren't available "out of the box," Jekyll still makes them possible with just a few customizations.

Hereâ€™s exactly how I handle such cases clearly and efficiently:

#### Creating Custom Layouts for Specific Page Types

In standard Jekyll themes (such as [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/)), all pages typically share the same layout (e.g., `default.html`). If a project demands unique designs or layouts per page, I take the following steps:

**1. Create custom components (includes)**

- If I need a different **hero section**, for example:
    - Duplicate the existing `hero.html` in the `_includes/` folder.
    - Rename the duplicated file (e.g., `hero-custom.html`) and customize its design or content.

**2. Duplicate and modify the layout file**

- In the `_layouts/` folder, duplicate the default layout (usually `default.html`).
- Rename the copy (e.g., `custom-hero.html`) and assign the newly created custom include:
```
{% raw %}{% include hero-custom.html %}{% endraw %}
```

**3. Assign this new layout to specific pages**

- In the front matter of the relevant pages, specify the new layout:
  ```
  ---
  layout: custom-hero
  title: Custom Hero Page
  ---
  ```

This way, only the selected pages will feature the custom hero, while the rest remain on the default layout.

#### More Customization Ideas:

This same approach works equally well for:

- **Alternate footers**:
    - Create variations like `footer-simple.html` for minimal footers or special landing page footers.
- **Special landing pages without navigation**:
    - Create a layout without the navigation include for better conversions on landing or lead-capture pages.
- **Multilingual websites**:
    - For bilingual sites, create separate layouts like `default_en.html` and `default_de.html`.
    - Each layout then includes language-specific navigation (`nav-en.html`, `nav-de.html`) and footers, ensuring visitors see only content in their chosen language.

By following this modular, structured approach, I can offer clients fully customized designs while maintaining Jekyll's simplicity, speed, and maintainability.



### Extending Jekyll with External Tools

Jekyll, on its own, is intentionally simple, but it can be easily extended with external tools and services to add functionality typically associated with dynamic websites. Here are some of my go-to options for adding functionality typically associated with dynamic websites:

- **Form Handling**
  - [Netlify Forms](https://www.netlify.com/products/forms/)
  - [Formspree](https://formspree.io/)
  - [Formspark](https://formspark.io/)

- **Search Functionality**
  - [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) (powerful search service)
  - JavaScript-based search libraries (already built into [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme)

- **Enhanced Styling & Animations**
  - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling)
  - [GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)](https://greensock.com/gsap/) (JavaScript animation library for advanced animations and interactions)

- **Embedding Social Media Feeds**
  - [SociableKIT](https://www.sociablekit.com/) (Embed social media feeds from Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, etc.)
  - I use this occasionally, including on my own site, though it comes with some styling limitations and can slightly impact site speed.

- **E-commerce & Payments**
  - [Snipcart](https://snipcart.com/)
  - [Shopify Buy Button](https://www.shopify.com/buy-button)
  - [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/checkout)

- **Comment Systems & User Interaction**
  - [Disqus](https://disqus.com/)
  - [Staticman](https://staticman.net/)
  - [Commento](https://commento.io/)

These integrations enable Jekyll websites to offer richer functionalities while still benefiting from simplicity, performance, and security.
