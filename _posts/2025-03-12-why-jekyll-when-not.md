## Introduction

When I started my web development business, Jekyll was my tool of choice. I wanted a way to build fast, secure, and customizable websites without unnecessary complexity. Over the past few years‚Äîespecially in the last 15 months‚Äîthings have taken off. I‚Äôve worked with over 30 clients across different industries, refining my workflow and testing different tools along the way.

Through all of that, Jekyll has remained one of my go-to solutions. It helps me streamline my development process, deliver affordable, high-performance websites, and create custom designs without bloated platforms.

That said, Jekyll isn‚Äôt always the right choice. Some projects require more dynamic features, and in those cases, I turn to other tools.

In this post, I‚Äôll share:

- Why I use Jekyll for many client projects
- When it‚Äôs the best choice‚Äîand when it‚Äôs not
- How it fits into my web development workflow

If you're a business owner, freelancer, or developer looking for cost-effective, high-performance websites, this guide will help you understand when Jekyll makes sense‚Äîand when to use something else.

## A Quick Detour: What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a tool that builds websites as simple, static files instead of relying on a database-driven system like WordPress. Instead of generating pages dynamically on each visit, Jekyll pre-builds the entire site in advance, turning content written in Markdown, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a fully functional website that is fast, secure, and easy to host.

Originally created for GitHub Pages, Jekyll works well with Git, a version control and collaboration tool widely used in IT projects, making it easy to update and deploy changes. It‚Äôs built with Ruby and uses Liquid templates to create reusable layouts and dynamic content without needing a backend.

Since everything is pre-built before the site goes live, Jekyll sites load quickly, work well with content delivery networks for global performance, and don‚Äôt require ongoing maintenance. Jekyll sites can be hosted for free on platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, and Vercel, keeping costs low.

## Why Jekyll Is My Go-To for Many Projects

### Free, Cost-Effective Hosting

One of the biggest advantages of Jekyll is that it eliminates ongoing hosting costs. Websites built with Jekyll can be hosted for free on platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel, meaning clients only need to pay for a domain. There are no monthly platform fees like with WordPress, Webflow, or other hosted solutions, and no maintenance costs for server updates or security patches.

For smaller businesses, freelancers, or individuals with limited budgets, this has been a game-changer. Many of my clients were expecting ongoing fees for hosting and CMS subscriptions, and they were extremely happy to realize that their website could run at zero cost. This has been especially valuable for those just starting out, where every dollar saved matters.

While I‚Äôm expanding into working with larger businesses as well, affordability remains a key factor for many of my clients. Jekyll allows me to offer high-quality websites without locking them into expensive long-term costs.

### Speed & Performance

Jekyll‚Äôs biggest advantage in performance comes from the fact that it pre-generates every page as static HTML. Unlike database-driven websites that build pages dynamically each time a visitor loads them, Jekyll sites are already fully rendered and ready to go. This means:

- **Ultra-fast load times** ‚Äì Since there‚Äôs no database to query or backend logic to process, pages load almost instantly.
- **Better SEO** ‚Äì Google favors fast websites, and speed directly impacts search rankings. A Jekyll site has a natural advantage over heavier platforms that rely on real-time content generation.
- **Lower server load** ‚Äì With fewer moving parts, Jekyll sites can handle high traffic effortlessly. There‚Äôs no need for caching plugins or performance optimizations just to keep the site running smoothly.
- **Seamless CDN integration** ‚Äì Jekyll sites work well with content delivery networks (CDNs), ensuring fast load times worldwide. Since the site is already static, distributing it across global servers is simple and highly effective.

For clients, this speed boost means a better user experience, higher engagement, and in many cases, better conversion rates. A slow-loading website can drive visitors away, while a snappy, responsive one helps keep them engaged.


### Security & Reliability

One of the biggest risks with database-driven websites is security. Platforms like WordPress rely on a backend, user authentication, and third-party plugins‚Äîall of which can introduce vulnerabilities if not properly maintained. Jekyll, on the other hand, removes many of these risks by eliminating the need for a database or server-side processing.

- **Fewer security risks** ‚Äì No database means no exposure to SQL injection attacks or unauthorized data access.
- **No server-side code** ‚Äì Since Jekyll sites are static, there are no exploitable backend scripts or plugin vulnerabilities.
- **Peace of mind** ‚Äì No need for constant security patches, reducing the risk of website hacks or unexpected maintenance issues.

A great example of this came from a client who had his website on WordPress but ran into **security issues, including data breaches**. He liked the design of his site but was tired of the maintenance and security concerns. I rebuilt his website in Jekyll, keeping the same look and feel, while improving responsiveness and user experience. The result? A faster, safer, and more reliable site‚Äîwithout the security headaches he previously dealt with.

For businesses that don‚Äôt need frequent backend updates or user authentication, Jekyll offers a **simple, secure alternative** that removes many of the common risks of traditional CMS platforms.

















üîπ 3. Security & Reliability

3Ô∏è‚É£ When Jekyll Is Not the Right Choice
‚ùå 1. When Clients Need a Fully Dynamic Website
No built-in user authentication, real-time updates, or live interactions.
E-commerce limitations ‚Üí Needs third-party tools like Snipcart or Shopify Buy Button.
Alternatives: Next.js, WordPress, or custom React-based solutions.
‚ùå 2. When Clients Need a WYSIWYG CMS
No built-in content management system (CMS) ‚Üí Content changes require Markdown & Git.
Non-technical clients may struggle to edit content.
Alternatives: Webflow, WordPress, or a headless CMS like Contentful.
‚ùå 3. When Scaling Becomes an Issue
Large sites (1,000+ pages) = Slow build times.
Frequent content updates require full site rebuilds ‚Üí Not efficient for news sites or high-traffic blogs.
Alternatives: Hugo (faster builds), Next.js (hybrid static/dynamic).
‚ùå 4. When Clients Want Custom Web Applications or Highly Complex Designs
No built-in backend/database for storing user-generated content.
Limited interactivity ‚Üí Needs external APIs for advanced features.
Fully custom, highly interactive, or animation-heavy designs are possible but require a lot of manual coding and workarounds.
Alternatives: React.js (for interactive components), Webflow (for no-code/low-code custom layouts), or full frameworks like Django/Laravel for large-scale applications.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Workarounds & Customization Strategies for Jekyll
üîπ 1. Making Jekyll More Client-Friendly
Use headless CMS solutions (Netlify CMS, Forestry, Contentful) for a user-friendly editor.
Editable sections for clients:
Clients can update news, blog posts, and announcements easily in Markdown.
Jekyll templates can be configured for specific sections clients need control over.
üîπ 2. Customizing Jekyll Beyond Its Intended Use
Handling different layouts per page:
Most Jekyll themes (like Minimal Mistakes) are designed for uniform layouts.
If a project requires completely different layouts for subpages, duplicate layout files and assign them via front matter.
Advanced customization:
Modify theme includes, Liquid templates, and CSS to allow more unique page variations.
Use specific layout trackers to differentiate designs per section.
üîπ 3. Extending Jekyll with External Tools
Forms: Use Formspree, Formspark, Netlify Forms, or similar for form handling.
Search: Implement Algolia or JavaScript-based search (Minimal Mistakes theme already includes this).
E-commerce: Use Snipcart, Shopify Buy Button, or Stripe for payments.
Comments & User Interaction: Add Disqus, Staticman, or Commento for blog discussions.
