## Introduction

When I started my web development business, Jekyll was my tool of choice. I wanted a way to build fast, secure, and customizable websites without unnecessary complexity. Over the past few years—especially in the last 15 months—things have taken off. I’ve worked with over 30 clients across different industries, refining my workflow and testing different tools along the way.

Through all of that, Jekyll has remained one of my go-to solutions. It helps me streamline my development process, deliver affordable, high-performance websites, and create custom designs without bloated platforms.

That said, Jekyll isn’t always the right choice. Some projects require more dynamic features, and in those cases, I turn to other tools.

In this post, I’ll share:

- Why I use Jekyll for many client projects
- When it’s the best choice—and when it’s not
- How it fits into my web development workflow

If you're a business owner, freelancer, or developer looking for cost-effective, high-performance websites, this guide will help you understand when Jekyll makes sense—and when to use something else.

## A Quick Detour: What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a tool that builds websites as simple, static files instead of relying on a database-driven system like WordPress. Instead of generating pages dynamically on each visit, Jekyll pre-builds the entire site in advance, turning content written in Markdown, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a fully functional website that is fast, secure, and easy to host.

Originally created for GitHub Pages, Jekyll works well with Git, a version control and collaboration tool widely used in IT projects, making it easy to update and deploy changes. It’s built with Ruby and uses Liquid templates to create reusable layouts and dynamic content without needing a backend.

Since everything is pre-built before the site goes live, Jekyll sites load quickly, work well with content delivery networks for global performance, and don’t require ongoing maintenance. Jekyll sites can be hosted for free on platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, and Vercel, keeping costs low.

## Why Jekyll Is My Go-To for Many Projects

### Free, Cost-Effective Hosting

One of the biggest advantages of Jekyll is that it eliminates ongoing hosting costs. Websites built with Jekyll can be hosted for free on platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel, meaning clients only need to pay for a domain. There are no monthly platform fees like with WordPress, Webflow, or other hosted solutions, and no maintenance costs for server updates or security patches.

For smaller businesses, freelancers, or individuals with limited budgets, this has been a game-changer. Many of my clients were expecting ongoing fees for hosting and CMS subscriptions, and they were extremely happy to realize that their website could run at zero cost. This has been especially valuable for those just starting out, where every dollar saved matters.

While I’m expanding into working with larger businesses as well, affordability remains a key factor for many of my clients. Jekyll allows me to offer high-quality websites without locking them into expensive long-term costs.

### Speed & Performance

Jekyll’s biggest advantage in performance comes from the fact that it pre-generates every page as static HTML. Unlike database-driven websites that build pages dynamically each time a visitor loads them, Jekyll sites are already fully rendered and ready to go. This means:

- **Ultra-fast load times** – Since there’s no database to query or backend logic to process, pages load almost instantly.
- **Better SEO** – Google favors fast websites, and speed directly impacts search rankings. A Jekyll site has a natural advantage over heavier platforms that rely on real-time content generation.
- **Lower server load** – With fewer moving parts, Jekyll sites can handle high traffic effortlessly. There’s no need for caching plugins or performance optimizations just to keep the site running smoothly.
- **Seamless CDN integration** – Jekyll sites work well with content delivery networks (CDNs), ensuring fast load times worldwide. Since the site is already static, distributing it across global servers is simple and highly effective.

For clients, this speed boost means a better user experience, higher engagement, and in many cases, better conversion rates. A slow-loading website can drive visitors away, while a snappy, responsive one helps keep them engaged.


### Security & Reliability

One of the biggest risks with database-driven websites is security. Platforms like WordPress rely on a backend, user authentication, and third-party plugins—all of which can introduce vulnerabilities if not properly maintained. Jekyll, on the other hand, removes many of these risks by eliminating the need for a database or server-side processing.

- **Fewer security risks** – No database means no exposure to SQL injection attacks or unauthorized data access.
- **No server-side code** – Since Jekyll sites are static, there are no exploitable backend scripts or plugin vulnerabilities.
- **Peace of mind** – No need for constant security patches, reducing the risk of website hacks or unexpected maintenance issues.

<div class="notice--danger">
A great example of this came from a client who had his website on WordPress but ran into security issues, including data breaches. He liked the design of his site but was tired of the maintenance and security concerns.
</div>
<div class="notice--success">
I rebuilt his website in Jekyll, keeping the same look and feel, while improving responsiveness and user experience. The result? A faster, safer, and more reliable site—without the security headaches he previously dealt with.
</div>

For businesses that don’t need frequent backend updates or user authentication, Jekyll offers a **simple, secure alternative** that removes many of the common risks of traditional CMS platforms.

### Full Control & Customization

Many CMS platforms offer customization, but they often come with limitations—locked-down themes, rigid templates, or complex plugin dependencies. With Jekyll, customization is straightforward because I can **edit the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript directly**. There’s no need to work around theme restrictions—every part of the site is accessible and fully adjustable.

Jekyll also uses **Liquid**, a templating language that makes it easier to structure content dynamically. Instead of repeating the same HTML code across multiple pages, I can create **reusable components** for headers, footers, or blog post previews. Liquid allows me to insert dynamic content, loop through lists (like blog posts or project portfolios), and conditionally display elements—without needing a database or backend scripting.

<div class="notice--success">
And on a personal note—it’s just more fun to write code than to drag and drop elements around. 😆
</div>

### Efficient, Templatized Development for Affordable, High-Quality Websites

Jekyll allows for **theme-based development**, making it possible to build high-quality websites quickly while keeping costs low for clients. Themes like [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) and [OneFlow](https://oneflow-jekyll-theme.github.io/)(which is a theme I build myself and use for many projects) provide a strong foundation with pre-built components such as navigation menus, content boxes, notices, galleries, and typography styles. These reusable elements help structure the site efficiently while still allowing for complete customization.

Unlike many CMS platforms where themes can be restrictive, Jekyll gives full access to all theme files, including CSS, JavaScript, and Liquid templates. This means I can adjust everything—from layout structure to interactive elements—while still benefiting from the efficiency of a theme-based workflow. Each page can also include fully custom elements/code, making it easy to tailor the design to a client’s brand and needs.

- **Faster development with templates** – By starting with a structured theme instead of coding everything from scratch, I can build websites much faster, which means lower costs for clients.
- **Affordable but custom** – Clients get a well-designed, responsive website without paying for a fully custom-coded solution. The structure is efficient, but every project is still unique.
- **Easy future updates** – Since the codebase is clean and modular, making changes later is simple, allowing businesses to expand their site without a full rebuild.
- **Fast turnaround without sacrificing quality** – With structured themes and reusable components, I can deliver high-quality websites quickly while maintaining performance, security, and scalability.

<div class="notice--info">
This approach has been a key factor in my business success. By streamlining my development like this, I can offer affordable, high-quality websites due to the efficiency of the process.
</div>

### Ideal for Content-Centric Websites

Jekyll is an excellent choice for **content-driven websites**, whether they focus on text, images, or a mix of both. It works well for sites that need frequent updates, like blogs and documentation pages, but is also great for simple business websites that don’t require constant changes.

I use Jekyll myself for my **Panorama Perspectives blog ([blog.perstarke-webdev.de](https://blog.perstarke-webdev.de/))**, built with the Minimal Mistakes theme. Writing new content is as easy as creating a Markdown file, pushing it to Git, and the website updates automatically.

For clients, this system offers several benefits:

- **Simple content management** – Markdown makes formatting easy without requiring technical skills. Clients can edit or add content without touching complex HTML or code.
- **No costly CMS subscriptions** – Unlike WordPress, Squarespace, or similar platforms, Jekyll doesn’t require monthly fees for content management. Clients can publish content for free.
- **Great for static or frequently updated sites** – Jekyll works just as well for businesses that only need a simple, well-designed site with no ongoing updates, as it does for blogs or documentation pages that require regular content changes.
- **Options for even easier editing** – If a client needs a more user-friendly editing experience, I can integrate a tool like Netlify CMS, which provides a simple web-based interface for updating content—without needing direct access to the code or files.

<div class="notice--warning">
I haven’t used Netlify CMS in a project yet, but I’m currently starting a new project where I’ll most likely implement it for the first time—something I’m really excited about. This will make content updates even easier for clients who prefer a non-technical interface, while still keeping the advantages of Jekyll’s speed and simplicity.
</div>


### Efficient Developer Workflow

Jekyll integrates seamlessly with **Git-based version control**, making development more flexible, organized, and risk-free. Whether working solo or collaborating with another developer, Git ensures that every change is tracked and reversible—something that’s much harder to manage on platforms like WordPress or Squarespace.

- **Version control & rollbacks** – There have been times, especially early on, when I experimented with a design idea and completely messed things up (if you're a developer, you know the feeling 😆). With Git, which works perfectly with Jekyll, I can simply revert to a previous version and start fresh without losing anything.
- **Seamless collaboration** – When working with other developers, Git allows us to make changes in parallel without worrying about overwriting each other’s work—unlike platforms like WordPress or Squarespace, where simultaneous edits can cause conflicts.
- **Easy local development** – I love deploying Jekyll in a Docker environment, allowing me to preview changes instantly on my local machine before pushing anything live. This makes testing and refining the site much faster and more reliable.
- **Preview live changes before launch** – Since Jekyll builds static files, it’s easy to set up test domains or local previews so clients can see the site before going live, without affecting the production version.

These features make Jekyll a **developer-friendly platform** that encourages risk-free experimentation, smooth teamwork, and a structured workflow. 












3️⃣ When Jekyll Is Not the Right Choice
❌ 1. When Clients Need a Fully Dynamic Website
No built-in user authentication, real-time updates, or live interactions.
E-commerce limitations → Needs third-party tools like Snipcart or Shopify Buy Button.
Alternatives: Next.js, WordPress, or custom React-based solutions.
❌ 2. When Clients Need a WYSIWYG CMS
No built-in content management system (CMS) → Content changes require Markdown & Git.
Non-technical clients may struggle to edit content.
Alternatives: Webflow, WordPress, or a headless CMS like Contentful.
❌ 3. When Scaling Becomes an Issue
Large sites (1,000+ pages) = Slow build times.
Frequent content updates require full site rebuilds → Not efficient for news sites or high-traffic blogs.
Alternatives: Hugo (faster builds), Next.js (hybrid static/dynamic).
❌ 4. When Clients Want Custom Web Applications or Highly Complex Designs
No built-in backend/database for storing user-generated content.
Limited interactivity → Needs external APIs for advanced features.
Fully custom, highly interactive, or animation-heavy designs are possible but require a lot of manual coding and workarounds.
Alternatives: React.js (for interactive components), Webflow (for no-code/low-code custom layouts), or full frameworks like Django/Laravel for large-scale applications.
4️⃣ Workarounds & Customization Strategies for Jekyll
🔹 1. Making Jekyll More Client-Friendly
Use headless CMS solutions (Netlify CMS, Forestry, Contentful) for a user-friendly editor.
Editable sections for clients:
Clients can update news, blog posts, and announcements easily in Markdown.
Jekyll templates can be configured for specific sections clients need control over.
🔹 2. Customizing Jekyll Beyond Its Intended Use
Handling different layouts per page:
Most Jekyll themes (like Minimal Mistakes) are designed for uniform layouts.
If a project requires completely different layouts for subpages, duplicate layout files and assign them via front matter.
Advanced customization:
Modify theme includes, Liquid templates, and CSS to allow more unique page variations.
Use specific layout trackers to differentiate designs per section.
🔹 3. Extending Jekyll with External Tools
Forms: Use Formspree, Formspark, Netlify Forms, or similar for form handling.
Search: Implement Algolia or JavaScript-based search (Minimal Mistakes theme already includes this).
E-commerce: Use Snipcart, Shopify Buy Button, or Stripe for payments.
Comments & User Interaction: Add Disqus, Staticman, or Commento for blog discussions.
5️⃣ Best Use Cases for Jekyll
✔ Blogs & Developer Blogs → Simple Markdown-based writing & publishing.
✔ Portfolio & Personal Branding Sites → Fast, lightweight, easy to manage.
✔ Company Websites with Mostly Static Content → Great for startups, small businesses.
✔ Documentation Websites → API docs, manuals, and knowledge bases.
✔ Marketing Landing Pages → SEO-friendly, blazing fast lead capture pages.

6️⃣ Alternatives Depending on the Use Case
💡 For large-scale static sites → Hugo (faster builds).
💡 For hybrid static & dynamic features → Next.js, Astro.
💡 For easy client content updates → WordPress, Webflow, Contentful.
💡 For full interactivity & web apps → React, Django, Laravel, Strapi.
💡 For e-commerce → Shopify, Snipcart, WooCommerce.

7️⃣ Conclusion: Is Jekyll Right for Your Project?
If you need fast, secure, and cost-effective websites, Jekyll is a great choice.
If your project requires user interactivity, easy content updates (other than blog posts), or heavy dynamic features, alternatives may be better.
Jekyll remains a powerful tool for developers who value efficiency, security, and low maintenance.
