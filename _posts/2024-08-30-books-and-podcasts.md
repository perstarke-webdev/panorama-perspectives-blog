Welcome to my personally curated list of book and podcast recommendations! 
This collection isn’t sorted by topic because many of these resources cross over into multiple areas, 
and I wanted to avoid repetition to keep things simple and engaging. 
While this list includes some well-known classics you might already be familiar with, 
it also features several hidden gems that have brought a lot of value to my life. 
Whether you’re looking for inspiration, education, or insights into new perspectives, 
I hope you find something here that resonates just as strongly with you. Enough talking, let's dive in! 

<div class="notice--info">
    Quick side-note, if you want to get one of the books, you can support me by using the affiliate links I provide here.
    Thank you!
</div>

<div class="notice--danger">
    Most of these books are available in English and German (and other languages), some sadly are not available in English.
    If that is the case, I clearly marked that!

This is currently my all-time favorite book in the personal development domain.
Covey's principle-centered approach offers solutions for personal and professional challenges 
and has profoundly influenced my own life. 
For good reason, I have the diagram representing the 7 habits hanging on my door! 
If you're looking to delve into just one book about personal change, this should be at the top of your list.

A quick read with a simple yet powerful message:

The philosophy is simple yet profound: make work, studying, and life as enjoyable as possible to 
maximize productivity in areas that truly matter to you. 
This book is packed with experiments, actionable tips, and personalized strategies to explore.
It’s evident that Ali takes his own advice, which I really appreciate.
I think no book ever contained more things that I directly and easily could (and did) start to apply to my own life. 
It’s one of my top recommendations for anyone looking to enhance their productivity with a positive twist.

This book serves as a profound inspiration to push beyond your perceived limits and achieve what seems impossible. 
David Goggins' story is extreme, and while it isn’t a blueprint for everyone to follow exactly, 
the book makes that clear. What I love most is the blend of actionable tips and challenges 
mixed into Goggins' own life story.

***Tim Ferriss***

This book is packed with actionable strategies and insights that can revolutionize your approach to work and free up more time for the things you love. It's a must-read for anyone looking to optimize their productivity and live life to the fullest. (Some content is a little outdated, but most advice will still work.)

***Jordan B. Peterson***   
*[Get the book](https://amzn.to/4cSXc1l)*  
This book has been a daily guide for me, not just a read. 
It presents a series of life principles that offer structure and understanding in a complex world.

the insights in the book can still offer valuable perspectives.

This book contains many valuable insights and really made me "think again." It offered new perspectives that I hadn't experienced or thought about before. In today's fast-changing world, questioning your tools, values and many other things is often overlooked but, as this book clearly proves, crucial.

In today's world, it’s getting harder and harderr to tell what's true and what’s not. *Calling Bullshit* is a book everyone should read. It teaches you how to spot misinformation and nonsense, which is crucial nowadays. Bergstrom and West use insightful language and real-life examples to show you how to think critically about the information you come across. It's a practical and eye-opening read that helps you cut through the BS and find the facts.

## On Writing Well: The Classic Guide to Writing Nonfiction
***William Zinsser***   
*[Get the book](https://amzn.to/44mAVFe)*  
I consider this book an absolute masterpiece! 
It’s a guide on writing well, so naturally, one would expect it to be well-written, 
but it truly exceeded my expectations. Zinsser offers a wealth of actionable advice that can be applied immediately, 
no matter what kind of nonfiction you're tackling. Additionally, the first few pages not only captured my attention 
but also made me laugh more than I expected.

## (Not available in English, sadly) Drei Fragen: Wer bin ich? Wohin gehe ich? Und mit wem?
***Jorge Bucay***   
*[Get the book](https://amzn.to/4apytQB)*  
The title translates as *"Three questions: Who am I? Where am I going? And with whom?"*.  
I love how Bucay gets straight to the point and gives helpful advice to answer these vital life questions.  
Even though I do not fully agree with all statements in the book, especially the first half of it
was quite transformative for me and had such a significant impact that I definitely wanted to include it in this list.

This book offers extremely practical and golden advice on how to prime your mind for winning, whether in sports or other domains. While I didn't find the style of writing particularly engaging, the quality of the advice more than makes up for it. The book is packed with great tips that can help anyone develop a winning mindset. I took away a lot from this invaluable read and highly recommend it to anyone who wants to succeed.


## The 12 Week Year   
***Brian P. Moran and Michael Lennington***  
[Get the book](https://amzn.to/3WVA8ZM)  
I found "The 12 Week Year" to be packed with practical advice that really makes a difference. The idea of setting goals and making plans for 12 weeks instead of 12 months is a game-changer—let’s be serious, those year-long goals often suck. The focus on personal accountability is especially powerful; it’s a reminder of how crucial it is to take responsibility for your progress. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to improve their productivity and get real results in a shorter amount of time. I love applying this approach to my own life.


## The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life     
***Mark Manson***   
[Get the book](https://amzn.to/3wHWdkj)   
This thought-provoking read features a very straightforward style of writing, which I enjoyed a lot. Mark's approach is different than other books and therefore very refreshing. I don't fully agree with all his statements (e.g., the blanket "you are not special," because in my point of view that is also a choice you can make), but even those parts were very interesting to read. Many ideas, though, are damn good and valuable! Especially things like "we all have a limited amount of f\*cks to give, so we must choose our f\*cks wisely" or "not everything in your life is your fault, but everything is your own full responsibility" are so good! Recommended and very valuable read for sure.


## Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion   
***Robert Cialdini***    
*[Get the book](https://amzn.to/4cEEBpr)*    
*"Influence"* was one of the most interesting books I've ever read, packed with tons of deep psychological insights. Robert Cialdini masterfully presents very illustrative and eye-opening examples throughout the book, making complex concepts easy to understand and apply. It's a compelling read that delves into the mechanics of persuasion and the subtle ways in which we can be influenced. Highly recommend this book for anyone interested in understanding the intricacies of human behavior and the art of persuasion. Additionally, it provides valuable information on using persuasion ethically and how to protect oneself against its misuse in advertising, sales, and other areas.


## Learn Better: Mastering the Skills for Success in Life, Business, and School
***Ulrich Boser***  
[Get the book](https://amzn.to/4dK7VLp)  
"Learn Better" by Ulrich Boser was a real eye-opener for me. It dives deep into how we can improve the way we learn, which is something most of us don't think about enough. Learning is such a crucial skill, but we often go about it in ineffective ways. Boser breaks down learning into simple, practical strategies that anyone can use. I found his tips on active engagement and the power of self-reflection especially helpful. It's not about working harder, but working smarter. This book is great for anyone who wants to learn better in any area of life—whether it's for school, work, or personal growth. Super useful!


## Level Up: Get Focused, Stop Procrastinating and Upgrade Your Life
***Rob Dial***   
*[Get the book](https://amzn.to/49CC0K5)*  
Rob Dial’s podcast *"The Mindset Mentor"*(see below) was my introduction to self development, 
creating a special connection for me. Motivated by numerous podcast episodes, 
I decided to dive into his book, and I'm glad I made that choice. 
Unlike his podcast, which often focuses on specific topics, **Level Up** provides a 
comprehensive overview of various strategies essential for achieving your goals, whatever they may be. 
While many chapters revisited concepts familiar from the podcast or other books, 
integrating them into a broader context was highly beneficial. 
Additionally, some sections offered new insights I hadn't encountered elsewhere. 
Overall, this book is an excellent resource, offering actionable advice and a straightforward approach to success
(whatever success personally means for you).
It serves as both a valuable refresher for those familiar with the subject of personal development 
and a solid foundation for newcomers looking to delve deeper.



## Sell Like Crazy: How To Get As Many Clients, Customers and Sales As You Can Possibly Handle
***Sabri Suby***   
*[Get the book](https://amzn.to/49w1GYU)*  
Despite its overtly salesy title and style of writing, which might be off-putting for some, 
this book provided me with unique insights that I haven't found elsewhere in such a comprehensive manner. 
If you're exploring marketing, this is definitely worth checking out. 
Look past the aggressive sales tone, and you'll discover a wealth of practical advice that goes beyond 
the basic marketing tips commonly found in videos and blog posts.

## (Not available in English, sadly) Neurowebdesign – Wie Hirnforschung und Psychologie das Webdesign beeinflussen
***Jonas Reggelin***   
*[Get the book](https://amzn.to/3W10XM6)*  
Over 90% of our decisions are made unconsciously, making it incredibly beneficial to tailor web design 
based on brain research. This book offers an in-depth look at the intersection of neuroscience and web design, 
providing both theoretical insights and practical advice. My clients and I have gained significant benefits 
from the approaches detailed in this book. If you’re interested in enhancing your website’s effectiveness 
through psychology, this is a must-read.

## Hello World: How to be Human in the Age of the Machine
***Hannah Fry***   
*[Get the book](https://amzn.to/4cXDeCt)*  
In the age of artificial intelligence (AI) and algorithms, pressing questions arise that we need to address. 
The book presents dilemmas such as 
*"You are accused of a crime. Who would you rather determined your fate - a human or a machine?"* and 
*"Which driverless car do you buy - one that prioritizes your life in the event of a crash or one 
that reacts to save as many lives as possible?"* 
These are not just theoretical questions; we are nearing a point where such decisions will become reality. 
This makes delving into the implications of AI and technology crucial, 
and Fry’s book provides an extremely valuable exploration of these topics.

## (Not available in English, sadly) Ethik in KI und Robotik
***Christoph Bartneck, Christoph Lütge, Alan R. Wagner, Sean Welsh***   
*[Get the book](https://amzn.to/3vTLKBY)*  
As our lives become increasingly impacted by AI and robotics, 
the ethical considerations of these technologies become more pressing. 
From autonomous vehicles on our roads to robots in healthcare and algorithms making critical decisions, 
the scope of AI and robotics in our daily lives is ever-growing. 
This book offers an essential introduction to the ethics involved, 
presenting complex issues in an accessible manner without requiring prior expertise. 
It’s a great read for anyone interested in understanding the ethical landscape of modern technology.

## The Mindset Mentor
***Rob Dial***   
*[Listen on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/706hylM6zaDW8LrrYxcggQ?si=7fca70a7373c4529)*  
*"The Mindset Mentor podcast is designed for anyone desiring motivation, direction, and focus in life."*  
That’s how it's described in the show notes, 
and it captures the essence perfectly. 
This podcast was my initial foray into personal development, 
laying the groundwork for a deeper exploration of the subject that has profoundly influenced my life. 
While I've since diversified my listening and reading habits, 
I regularly return to both new and old episodes of The Mindset Mentor. 
Some episodes serve as a valuable reminder of the principles I strive to live by,

## 20 Minute Books
*[Listen on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/0DCr5p9xsdBceiAtaPbW5Y?si=45685dc1adf8420e)*  
This Podcast offers quick, insightful summaries of books,
functioning similarly to services like [Blinkist](https://www.blinkist.com/en/), 
but since it's available on Spotify, it integrates seamlessly with my existing subscriptions. 
While I prefer the depth that reading full books provides, 
these concise summaries are incredibly valuable. 
They allow me to cover more ground—listening is easy during car drives, walks, or even while cleaning. 
If a summary grabs my attention, I can always decide to read the full book later. 
I also appreciate revisiting summaries of books I’ve read to refresh their key concepts. 
Additionally, this podcast is perfect for briefly exploring new topics and ideas without committing 
to a full-length book.

## Guided Sleep Meditation & Sleep Hypnosis from Sleep Cove
***Sleep Hypnosis, Meditations and Bedtime Stories***   
*[Listen on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/5mSCDO2x32DwnwDdtYvM6L?si=035a45cdc6834a26)*  
We all know how crucial good sleep is for our bodies and brains to function properly. 
There are various strategies to improve sleep, and one lesser-known approach is guided sleep meditations. 
I’ve tried many different ones and have seen a significant improvement in how quickly I fall asleep 
and the overall quality of my sleep.
Out of all the options I’ve explored, the Sleep Cove Podcast has been the most effective for me. 
I particularly enjoy the [*"Deep Relaxing Sleep Hypnosis"* episode](https://open.spotify.com/episode/68Btgjm4RTWhAIEKUKkpf8?si=d84b8118c2c44bec), 
which has become my go-to nightly routine. 
It’s definitely worth trying if you’re looking for a new way to enhance your sleep. My experiences have been very positive!

making it a favorite I regularly return to with enthusiasm.

***Kyle Prinsloo***  
*[Listen on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/27oYFuQyf6VZ18bKP0ffPB?si=010ffa9ec5204324)*  
This one truly lives up to its tagline, 
*"Freelancing and marketing nuggets for web designers, without the fluff."* 
It delivers precisely what it promises: straightforward, valuable content with no unnecessary filler. 
Although it primarily targets freelancers in web development, 
the insights provided are broadly applicable, benefiting freelancers across various fields as well as 
web developers who aren't freelancing. 
This makes it a standout resource for anyone looking to enhance their freelancing skills.

## The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck Podcast   
***Mark Manson***     
*[Listen on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/11VjrLJfoiNvgjjqov4RWh?si=28cda04e2dff4e65)*  
I'm already a fan of the book, but the podcast dives even deeper into some of the core topics, providing that same great vibe of getting shit done while enjoying life to the fullest. With Mark Manson's signature straightforward and humorous style, it's a pleasure to listen to. There's also a fantastic episode featuring Ali Abdaal on how to enjoy doing hard things and feel-good productivity, making it a standout.

## Soul sisters in sydney
*[Listen on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/6Uhn7JW7TaYwkd13YWOb1Q?si=1d79847458634011)*  
This one is kind of a hidden gem.
It's not very famous and was hard to find, but I really enjoy it a lot. 
Like my blog, this podcast isn't just about sharing expertise; it's more about sharing personal and relatable 
experiences. It covers everything from traveling and life in Australia to self development, friendship, 
and finding the right work/life balance. Sadly, it looks like no new episodes have been added since 2022, 
and there are only a few episodes available, but the ones that are there are definitely worth a listen
