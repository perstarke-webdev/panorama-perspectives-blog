excerpt: "I'm so happy to be studying abroad in Sydney, Australia! Of course, I want to make time to explore, meet new people, and enjoy the incredible places here—but I also have a business to run, a job, university, and competitive powerlifting. Here’s how I make it all work without missing out—and how you can, too!"

## Introduction

I'm incredibly grateful to be studying abroad in Sydney, Australia. With so much to explore—beautiful beaches, breathtaking hikes, a vibrant city, and of course, the **AMAZING** Australian coffee—I want to make the most of my time here. But at the same time, I have a lot on my plate: running my **freelance business**, working a **part-time job**, keeping up with **university**, and training for **competitive powerlifting**, all while staying connected with friends and family back home.

Finding the right balance between **getting things done and actually enjoying life** is something I’ve put a lot of thought into.

If you’re juggling multiple priorities—whether that’s **work and travel, studies and a side hustle, or just making time for your passions**—this post is for you. I’ll walk you through **my routine**, how I structure my weeks, and how I balance **structured work with flexibility** to stay both productive and present.

This isn’t about cramming more tasks into your day—it’s about **getting the important things done while still leaving space for adventure, spontaneity, and fun**.

Let’s dive in! 🚀


## **Core Strategy: Time Blocking**

With so many priorities, I need a system that keeps me on track **without feeling overwhelmed**—and that’s where **time blocking** comes in.

Rather than working from a vague to-do list, time blocking means **scheduling specific tasks into dedicated time slots**. I plan my work, university, training, and even free time in structured blocks, making sure everything fits—while still allowing room for flexibility.

The best part? It **shows me at a glance whether my time actually reflects my real priorities**—and lets me adjust when needed.

I won’t go into too much detail here, but if you want a **deep dive** into how I use time blocking to stay productive **without burning out**, check out this post:  
👉 [**How I Manage to Do Everything I Love: Time Blocking Tips and Personal Insights**](https://blog.perstarke-webdev.de/posts/time-blocking)

I also wrote about **work & travel strategies** in another post:  
👉 [**How I Stay Productive While Traveling**](https://blog.perstarke-webdev.de/posts/remote-work-while-traveling)

That one covers my experience during my **first trip to Australia**, an 8-week adventure where I balanced **running my business** with exploring new places—without the added complexity of university. If you’re curious about a **more flexible, travel-heavy** approach, you might enjoy that one too!  It also covers more of the fundamentals and less of the strict planning I will cover in this one.

## **How I Structure My Days and Weeks**

Time blocking helps me **allocate my time intentionally**, but the key to actually making it work is **how I structure my days and weeks**. Here's how I plan everything to make the most of all worlds.

### **Step 1: Locking in Fixed Commitments**

The first step in my routine is scheduling the **non-negotiable** tasks—things that happen at fixed times, such as:

✅ **University lectures** – These set the foundation of my weekly schedule.  
✅ **Work-related meetings** – Since I work both freelance and part-time, I schedule these first to avoid conflicts.

Once these are locked in, I can build the rest of my schedule around them.


### **Step 2: Scheduling Training for Maximum Impact**

Training is a huge priority for me—not just for self-improvement but also because the **team atmosphere in Australian powerlifting gyms** is something I’ve never experienced before. To make the most of it, I **align my training times with when the powerlifting crew is there**—usually in the early afternoon around 3:00 or 3:30 PM.

I train **five times a week** (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Sunday), so I schedule my gym sessions accordingly. This helps me:

✔️ **Train at peak energy levels**  
✔️ **Be part of a motivating gym community**  
✔️ **Make training a non-negotiable part of my routine**


### **Step 3: Planning Study & University Work Efficiently**

Since my lectures happen at fixed times, I **rework and prepare for them immediately after they happen**. Instead of letting study tasks pile up, I **schedule a 30–90-minute session right after each lecture**—so I can review the material while it’s still fresh.

For a **2-hour lecture**, my time block looks like this:  
📌 **2 hours for the lecture**  
📌 **90 minutes afterward to review & complete assignments** (with a short break in between to reset)

This way, **once I’m done, that lecture is fully completed for the week**—no last-minute catching up.

At the **end of the week (Friday)**, I schedule a **final study session** to:  
✅ Wrap up anything left unfinished  
✅ Prepare for the upcoming week

### **Step 4: Structuring Work & Business Tasks**

Since I have both a **part-time job** and my own **freelance business**, I structure my work sessions to maximize focus and efficiency.

🔹 **Freelance Work** – I prefer **long, deep-focus sessions** over scattered 1-hour blocks. I dedicate **one full 10–12-hour day** (like today, while writing this post!) to business tasks, working in **long, concentrated sessions** with short breaks in between—often a **walk, quick run, or coffee break**.

*I’ve found that long, deep-focus sessions work best for me, but some people prefer shorter sprints with more frequent breaks—find what keeps your energy up!*

In addition, I have **a few shorter 1–2-hour blocks** spread throughout the week for smaller business tasks.

🔹 **Part-Time Job** – Since I have a (roughly) set number of hours to complete each week, I **plan them in advance** and usually schedule them **in the mornings**, right after my routine check-ins with friends back home.

To **keep things productive but enjoyable**, I often **switch up my work environment**:

☕ **Cafés & Rooftops** – Changing locations keeps me energized, and working in a good atmosphere makes deep work more fun.  
📚 **University Library** – A focused vibe, great seating, and amazing city views make it one of my favorite places to **rework lecture notes**.  
💻 **Business Work Saturdays** – On these long workdays, I always include a session at one of my favorite cafés (greetings from [**Mecca Coffee**](https://www.mecca.coffee/pages/locations), enjoying one of the best espressos I’ve ever had while writing this post hihi).


### **Step 5: Making Time for Travel & Fun**

What’s the point of being in Australia if I don’t explore? 🌏 I make sure to schedule **both short and long trips** into my week—so I can get things done **and** enjoy the amazing places around me.

#### **Shorter Trips (1–2 hours):**
✔️ **Perfect for weekdays** after training  
✔️ Quick getaways to **beaches, city lookouts, or skyline views**  
✔️ Helps me **transition from intense training to a relaxed state**

📌 **Example:** After a heavy powerlifting session, I love heading to a scenic spot to **unwind**—often bringing my dinner with me for a **dinner-with-a-view** moment.

#### **Longer Trips (Half-Day to Full-Day):**
✔️ Scheduled on **Sundays and Wednesdays**  
✔️ **Sundays:** Train early, then spend the **rest of the day traveling**  
✔️ **Wednesdays:** Work or study in the **morning**, then **explore in the afternoon**

If urgent work or study tasks come up, I **adjust my schedule**—but I try to always make sure there’s time for at least **one proper adventure every week**.


### **Step 6: Eliminating Distractions & Staying Present**

I want to **enjoy both work and travel**, so I focus on **cutting out distractions**:

🚫 **No notifications** – I turn off any notifications and also mobile data for WhatsApp, Instagram, and emails.  
📵 **Phone-free moments while traveling** – I keep my phone away when exploring to **fully enjoy the experience**.

At the same time, I also make time for **social check-ins**:  
✔️ **Morning & evening** – I catch up with friends and family twice a day so I don’t feel disconnected, but still can stay away from my phone the rest of the day.


### **Step 7: Weekly Planning & Adjustments**

Every **Sunday**, I:  
🔹 Review my **upcoming week**  
🔹 Adjust my **schedule if needed**  
🔹 Make sure my **priorities are balanced**

Each **morning**, I quickly check my plan, pack what I need, and prepare for the day. While I allow flexibility, I **stick to my plan as much as possible**—because **I know I’ve scheduled time for everything that matters**.


### **Key Takeaway: Work Can Be Enjoyable Too**

Balancing work and travel isn’t just about **squeezing in productivity**—it’s about **making work itself enjoyable**.

I create a **work environment I love** by:  
✅ Working in **nice cafés, rooftop spaces, or libraries**  
✅ Taking **small breaks to enjoy the city**  
✅ Using my **student apartment’s setup** for deep-focus sessions

By making work enjoyable, it’s easier to **stay productive without feeling drained**—allowing me to **fully enjoy travel, training, and social life too**.

## **Final Thoughts: Balance is Possible**

By structuring my days intentionally, I can:  
✔️ **Get things done efficiently**  
✔️ **Stay consistent with training & work**  
✔️ **Still have time to explore & enjoy Australia**

I hope this post gives you some ideas to **create your own balance**—wherever you are or want to be in the world! 🚀
