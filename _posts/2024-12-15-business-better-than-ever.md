### **1. Introduction: My Before/After Story**

At the start of 2023, my web development business was always just a side project. I loved building websites, but deep down, I didn’t truly believe it could become my *main job* or something that would carry me into the future. It was something I enjoyed, but it felt like “just a hobby” – something to do *alongside* other responsibilities, not something to fully lean into.

Fast forward to now, and the growth has been incredible:
- **Blogpost reads:** 30x increase
- **Instagram reach:** 16x increase
- **Income:** 15x increase
- **Projects completed:** 6x more than last year

More importantly than the numbers, though, is what this growth *means* to me.  
I now get to focus on work that aligns with my passion. I build websites for people whose work I genuinely care about and support – clients I *want* to help succeed. My processes are smoother, and I can prioritize the most important work without burning out.

The best part? I enjoy my work more than ever. I get to work remotely from anywhere I choose, and I’m building a business that feels fully aligned with my vision: **helping others bring their passion to life so they can focus on what’s meaningful to them**.

Is it enough to fully live off yet? Not quite – but if this growth continues, I’m confident it will be. And that’s an *incredibly* exciting thought. Knowing that this can work, that I can make this my main thing, motivates me to keep going and keep building.
