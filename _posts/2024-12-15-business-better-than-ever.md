### **1. Introduction: My Before/After Story**

At the start of 2023, my web development business was always just a side project. I loved building websites, but deep down, I didn’t truly believe it could become my *main job* or something that would carry me into the future. It was something I enjoyed, but it felt like “just a hobby” – something to do *alongside* other responsibilities, not something to fully lean into.

Fast forward to now, and the growth has been incredible:
- **Blogpost reads:** 30x increase
- **Instagram reach:** 16x increase
- **Income:** 15x increase
- **Projects completed:** 6x more than last year

More importantly than the numbers, though, is what this growth *means* to me.  
I now get to focus on work that aligns with my passion. I build websites for people whose work I genuinely care about and support – clients I *want* to help succeed. My processes are smoother, and I can prioritize the most important work without burning out.

The best part? I enjoy my work more than ever. I get to work remotely from anywhere I choose, and I’m building a business that feels fully aligned with my vision: **helping others bring their passion to life so they can focus on what’s meaningful to them**.

Is it enough to fully live off yet? Not quite – but if this growth continues, I’m confident it will be. And that’s an *incredibly* exciting thought. Knowing that this can work, that I can make this my main thing, motivates me to keep going and keep building.

Here’s the draft for **Part 2: Treating It Like a Real Business**:



### **2. Treating It Like a Real Business**

One of the biggest changes this year? I stopped treating my web development business like a hobby and started treating it as what it has the potential to become: my *main thing*.

Of course, I still have my university studies and a part-time job, both of which are important. But I made a conscious decision to treat my business as *equally important* – if not more so – and to put everything I’ve got into it.

Why? Because, honestly, I have *nothing to lose*.  
Worst case? It doesn’t work out, and I still learn *a ton*.  
Best case? It *does* work out, and I get to spend my time doing something I truly enjoy, am passionate about, and that aligns with my vision for a fulfilling life. A life where I consciously choose how I live and design my days according to my terms.

This mindset shift alone made a *huge difference*.  
Instead of waiting for the right time or perfect circumstances, I blocked time in my calendar and stuck to it. Thanks to my time-blocking system, I divide my weekly work hours roughly into three parts:
- **A third for university** (because my degree is important, too).
- **A third for my part-time job** (which keeps things stable).
- **A third for my business** (the thing I actively chose to prioritize and grow).

And outside of those "official" hours?  
I use car rides, walks, hikes, and even casual chats with friends or clients to brainstorm, educate myself, and stay inspired. This doesn’t just help my business – it benefits my overall well-being, confidence, and creativity.

Taking my business seriously has been *transformational*. It’s no longer just something I do on the side – it’s something I actively design my life around. Treating it like it *matters* made it matter even more, and slowly but surely, it’s becoming exactly what I envisioned.
