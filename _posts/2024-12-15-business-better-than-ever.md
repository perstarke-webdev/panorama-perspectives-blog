### **1. Introduction: My Before/After Story**

At the start of 2023, my web development business was always just a side project. I loved building websites, but deep down, I didn’t truly believe it could become my *main job* or something that would carry me into the future. It was something I enjoyed, but it felt like “just a hobby” – something to do *alongside* other responsibilities, not something to fully lean into.

Fast forward to now, and the growth has been incredible:
- **Blogpost reads:** 30x increase
- **Instagram reach:** 16x increase
- **Income:** 15x increase
- **Projects completed:** 6x more than last year

More importantly than the numbers, though, is what this growth *means* to me.  
I now get to focus on work that aligns with my passion. I build websites for people whose work I genuinely care about and support – clients I *want* to help succeed. My processes are smoother, and I can prioritize the most important work without burning out.

The best part? I enjoy my work more than ever. I get to work remotely from anywhere I choose, and I’m building a business that feels fully aligned with my vision: **helping others bring their passion to life so they can focus on what’s meaningful to them**.

Is it enough to fully live off yet? Not quite – but if this growth continues, I’m confident it will be. And that’s an *incredibly* exciting thought. Knowing that this can work, that I can make this my main thing, motivates me to keep going and keep building.



### **2. Treating It Like a Real Business**

One of the biggest changes this year? I stopped treating my web development business like a hobby and started treating it as what it has the potential to become: my *main thing*.

Of course, I still have my university studies and a part-time job, both of which are important. But I made a conscious decision to treat my business as *equally important* – if not more so – and to put everything I’ve got into it.

Why? Because, honestly, I have *nothing to lose*.  
Worst case? It doesn’t work out, and I still learn *a ton*.  
Best case? It *does* work out, and I get to spend my time doing something I truly enjoy, am passionate about, and that aligns with my vision for a fulfilling life. A life where I consciously choose how I live and design my days according to my terms.

This mindset shift alone made a *huge difference*.  
Instead of waiting for the right time or perfect circumstances, I blocked time in my calendar and stuck to it. Thanks to my time-blocking system, I divide my weekly work hours roughly into three parts:
- **A third for university** (because my degree is important, too).
- **A third for my part-time job** (which keeps things stable).
- **A third for my business** (the thing I actively chose to prioritize and grow).

And outside of those "official" hours?  
I use car rides, walks, hikes, and even casual chats with friends or clients to brainstorm, educate myself, and stay inspired. This doesn’t just help my business – it benefits my overall well-being, confidence, and creativity.

Taking my business seriously has been *transformational*. It’s no longer just something I do on the side – it’s something I actively design my life around. Treating it like it *matters* made it matter even more, and slowly but surely, it’s becoming exactly what I envisioned.


### **3. Choosing My Channels and Staying Consistent**

At one point, I thought about trying podcasting too. But the more I considered it, the more I realized: blogging and Instagram just make way more sense for me.

For starters, I know my strengths. While I love the idea that you can learn anything, I also believe in playing to what comes naturally. Writing has always been my thing – I can express myself better and connect more clearly through words.

Instagram is a no-brainer too. Powerlifting coaches and athletes (aka my main niche) are super active there, so it’s the perfect place to share my work, connect with people, and also show some of my personal side (which I’ve realized is just as important).

And of course, as a web developer, my website has to be a reflection of what I can do. Over the past year, I’ve put a lot of work into making it a strong representation of both my professional skills and my personality. It’s where I can really showcase what makes me unique, share references, and send people to see exactly what I do. I’m proud of how it’s turned out – it’s my little digital home.

Consistency is the secret ingredient here. I post at least once a week – usually twice – and I make sure it’s regular. To keep everything running smoothly, I’ve built a system that works for me:
- A **Kanban board** keeps all my ideas and posts organized. I know exactly what’s in progress, what’s ready to go, and what’s still just an idea.
- I’ve created structured processes to brainstorm, draft, and schedule posts. Random ideas that pop into my head go straight into my notes, so I always have something ready when it’s time to create.

This approach has been such a game-changer. It’s helped me stay consistent, share content that feels meaningful, and position myself as approachable and passionate – not just about my work, but about connecting with others too.


### **4. Sharing the Personal Side – It’s Not Just About Work**

Another big change I made this year was integrating more of my personal side into my business content. I’ve always shared personal stuff – but only on my private Instagram account. This year, I brought that into my business account, my blog, and even my website.

I started showing things like:
- Where and how I work – whether it’s in cozy cafés, surrounded by nature, or on the go.
- My powerlifting journey, which is such a huge part of my live. 
- Small personal moments, like discovering the best vegan snacks or enjoying a great coffee.
- My vision and passion for the work I do.

Why? Because people connect with people, not just services. Sharing these parts of my life doesn’t just make my content more relatable – it makes my whole business feel more genuine.

This approach has helped me build deeper connections with clients. Many have told me they reached out because they saw my values and personality align with theirs. 
And it’s not just on Instagram or my blog; 
my website now reflects this personal touch too, both in content and design.
It’s not just about showcasing my work – it’s about showing who I am and what I stand for.

By sharing more of my personal side, I’ve created a business that’s not just a job – it’s a true reflection of me.


### **5. Supporting My Clients Beyond the Website**

This year, I made it a priority to show more of my clients and their amazing work. On my blog, Instagram, and even in casual conversations, I share not only the websites I create for them but also what they do – their businesses, their projects, their passions. These are things I genuinely love and want to support, so sharing them feels natural to me.

Why? Because I’m not just delivering a website. I want to see my clients succeed and know I’ve helped, even if just a little bit. Sharing their work helps them reach more people, builds stronger relationships, and lets them know I’m genuinely invested in their success. And it’s not just about them – it makes me happy too. When they thrive, I feel like I’ve contributed to something meaningful.

This also ties into another small, personal practice I started recently: sending handwritten and individually printed postcards to my clients after we’ve worked together. It’s a small gesture, but it means a lot to me. I truly appreciate their trust in me to support their vision, and taking the time to send a personal thank-you is one way to show that.

These thoughtful actions – sharing their work, sending postcards, and scheduling regular check-ins to make sure their websites continue to serve them well – are all part of what I call "over-delivering." I don’t just deliver the website and walk away. I go the extra mile to support them, building stronger relationships that bring happiness on both sides.

Over-delivering isn’t just about business; it’s about care. And in the long run, it always pays off – for them and for me. Stronger business relationships mean more referrals, returning clients, and, most importantly, a sense of fulfillment.


### **6. Regular R&D: Innovating, Testing, and Refining**

One of the most valuable lessons I’ve taken from my part-time job in Research & Development (R&D) is the importance of continuously testing, evaluating, and refining ideas. Applying this principle to my business has been a game-changer.

I’ve set up my own version of R&D, focusing on four core areas:
1. **Marketing:** Finding innovative ways to reach new clients and share my work.
2. **Services/Projects/Offerings:** Refining what I deliver to clients to add even more value.
3. **My Website:** Continuously improving how I represent myself online.
4. **Content and Content Strategy:** Enhancing the way I create, share, and structure content.

Every two weeks, I set aside time to reflect on what I’ve done so far in these areas. I evaluate what’s working, brainstorm new ideas to try, and decide which ones to prioritize next. Once I’ve chosen a focus, I break it down into actionable steps, set a (usually small) budget, and establish specific targets for measuring success.

#### **Prototyping New Ideas**
I like to think of this as “prototyping.” Instead of diving headfirst into a big, expensive plan, I start small, test the waters, and gather data. For example, one of my current marketing experiments is reaching startup and business-founding students through analog flyers placed at universities and startup meetups. My goal is to tap into a new niche and generate leads. The success of this idea is easy to track: I can measure it by the number of new clients or followers I gain directly from the flyers.

By starting small and evaluating results, I avoid wasting time and resources on strategies that don’t work, while doubling down on those that do. This keeps my business dynamic and ensures I’m always improving my processes, offerings, and overall approach.

#### **Tracking Key Metrics**
Another key part of R&D is deciding what to measure. While revenue is an important metric, I believe that in the earlier stages of a business, other data points can provide more actionable insights. For me, the metrics I track are:
- **Instagram Followers and Reach:** Instagram is one of my primary marketing platforms, so these numbers show how well my content is connecting.
- **Newly Interested Clients:** This tracks how many potential clients I’m reaching each week.
- **Client Ratings:** Happy clients are my top priority, and their feedback is invaluable for refining my work.

I review these metrics weekly, looking for trends over time. When I see improvements, I analyze what contributed to them and aim to replicate those strategies. If the numbers drop, I reflect on what could be done differently in the coming weeks.

By building R&D into my regular workflow, I ensure I stay adaptable, efficient, and focused. It’s a practice that not only drives innovation but also keeps my business aligned with my goals and values.


### **7. Refining Services and Defining a Clear Vision**

A huge part of my growth this year has been taking a hard look at my services and asking myself one simple question: **“How can I bring more value to my clients?”** This focus on value has shaped how I refine existing offerings and develop new ones. At the same time, I’ve kept revenue in mind, ensuring that every service is a win/win—for my clients and for my business.

#### **Building Clear, Flexible Offerings**
One of the most significant changes I made was splitting my website services into distinct, clearly defined options tailored to different needs and budgets:
- **Express Homepage (259€)**: For clients who need a professional website fast. Delivered within 72 hours.
- **Standard Homepage (499€+)**: My most popular option, offering custom design at an affordable price while minimizing work for the client.
- **Premium Homepage (999€+)**: For those who want a standout, highly detailed site. This service often includes complex features and personalization.
- **Comfort Web Success Package (577€ for the first year, then 148€/year)**: A comprehensive solution designed to make the process as smooth and hands-off as possible for the client.

Beyond these main services, I offer additional support like **website revisions, consulting, ongoing maintenance, social media announcements**, and more. Together, these options allow me to cater to a wide range of clients while keeping the focus on providing value.

#### **Defining and Aligning with My Vision**
Another key change this year was writing down my **vision statement**. I’ve always had a clear sense of what I love about my work, but putting it into words made it even clearer:  
**I’m passionate about helping my clients focus on what matters most to them by taking the stress of website creation off their shoulders.**

Getting crystal clear on my “why” has made a huge difference. This vision now serves as a guiding star for all my business decisions. It helps me align my services and actions with what I truly value—and also makes it easier to share my passion with potential clients.

#### **Sharing My Vision**
Sharing this vision has been a great way to connect with others. It’s now featured on my website’s “About Me” section, in my blog, and on Instagram. Not only does this help clients see what I stand for, but it also attracts the kind of people I love working with: passionate, driven individuals who appreciate my personal and professional approach.

By refining my offerings and aligning my work with a clear vision, I’ve created a strong foundation that benefits both my clients and my business. This clarity has not only made my services more effective but has also made my work infinitely more fulfilling.




### **8. Finding (and Expanding) My Niche**

One of the most common pieces of advice for entrepreneurs is to “find your niche.” It might sound cliché, but truly zoning in on a niche has made an **enormous difference** for my business.

#### **Starting with My Vision**
After writing my vision statement, it became clear to me that I wanted to work with smaller businesses rather than large corporations. For big, wealthy companies, there are plenty of incredible web development agencies that deliver outstanding websites—but often at astronomical prices, sometimes exceeding €10,000.

For smaller businesses or individuals, such prices simply aren’t feasible. Yet, these are the people I want to support. They deserve a stress-free, professional website without needing to navigate the complexity of building one themselves—because that distracts them from the work they care about and that drives their business forward.

So, I focused on **attracting small businesses and individuals** who share my values and need affordable, high-quality websites. That was already a niche, but not unique enough to stand out in a crowded market.

#### **Zooming In: Powerlifting**
There are thousands of freelance web developers who target smaller businesses. Many don’t share the same vision I have—and yes, many of them (sorrynotsorry) produce shitty work (Some are amazing though!!). But even so, the competition in this market is enormous.

So, I went one step further: I **focused on what I know, where I have connections, and where I’m part of the community.** That led me to powerlifting.

Powerlifting is a growing sport with more and more coaches—many of whom could benefit from having their own website. By specializing in **websites for powerlifting coaches**, I made myself **100% unique in Germany.**

If a powerlifting coach in Germany needs a website, chances are they’ll find me—because that’s my specialty. By narrowing my focus, I’ve positioned myself as an expert in a specific market. This approach has been one of the smartest decisions I’ve made in my business.

#### **The Challenges of a Small Niche**
Of course, such a specialized niche comes with challenges. The biggest drawback is its size—there are only so many powerlifting coaches in need of a website. The market is relatively small, which limits long-term growth.

That’s why I’ve already started **expanding into other niches**. While powerlifting coaches remain my core focus and area of expertise, I’ve begun targeting:
- **Other sports coaches**: CrossFit coaches are my top priority for next year as I expand my client base.
- **Small businesses**: I’ve already worked with cafés, startups, and other freelancers—and I absolutely love these projects.

#### **Balancing Expertise and Growth**
I still believe in the power of being an expert in a niche. For now, powerlifting coaches remain my main focus and I view my work with other small businesses as complementary “add-ons” to my niche. Balancing these areas allows me to grow strategically while staying true to my vision of helping people focus on what truly matters to them.

By specializing deeply while keeping room for expansion, I’ve built a solid foundation for both short-term and long-term success. This dual approach ensures I remain unique and highly valuable in my niche while also opening doors to exciting new opportunities.



### **9. The Power of Networking**

Networking is something I *completely* neglected before. I thought it wasn’t that important, and it didn’t come naturally to me. But this year, I’ve learned to embrace it—and wow, what a difference it makes!

#### **Building Connections Across All Areas**
Now, I have an incredibly diverse network that spans all kinds of people:
- **Fellow web developers**: We share experiences, tips, and even collaborate on projects.
- **Aspiring web developers**: People who are just starting out often bring fresh perspectives and enthusiasm.
- **Designers**: These are people who work with similar clients but focus on areas like logo or brand design—making us complementary collaborators.
- **Professionals in various industries**: From small businesses to larger companies, I’ve connected with people in many fields.

#### **How I Built My Network**
These connections didn’t happen by accident—I made a conscious effort to build them through various channels:
- **Client collaborations**: When I worked with clients who collaborated with designers or other professionals, I made sure to connect with those people too.
- **Social media outreach**: I messaged fellow web developers on Instagram, shared what I do, and asked about their work.
- **Content creation**: By consistently posting on my blog and Instagram, I positioned myself as an expert in my field. People recognized this and started reaching out to me directly.
- **Staying open to opportunities**: I made a point of responding to every message, inquiry, or question I received. You never know where a conversation might lead!
- **Putting myself out there**: I actively sought out conversations—whether in person or online. Sharing what I do and listening to others share their work has been a game-changer.

#### **Why Networking Matters**
The benefits of networking are endless. Of course, it helps me spread the word about my services and brings in referrals and word-of-mouth clients. But just as importantly, it allows me to:
- **Get feedback**: Networks give me valuable insights to improve my work and refine my processes.
- **Learn and grow**: Talking to others in the field has genuinely helped me create better websites.
- **Collaborate on exciting projects**: Right now, I’m working on two projects I would never have landed without my network. These are not only the **biggest client projects I’ve ever done**, but they’ve also taken me into domains I hadn’t even considered before. The work is fun, enriching, and a true highlight of my year!

#### **Content Creation as a Networking Tool**
A key part of building my network has been my **content creation.** Sharing regular blog posts and Instagram updates doesn’t just help me market my business—it also positions me as an expert while showing my personal side. This balance attracts like-minded people, opening doors to incredible opportunities and collaborations.

Networking has become one of the most valuable things I’ve done for my business—and for myself. It’s made my work more enjoyable, impactful, and connected. Looking back, I can’t believe I ever thought I didn’t need it!
