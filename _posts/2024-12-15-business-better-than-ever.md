### **1. Introduction: My Before/After Story**

At the start of 2023, my web development business was always just a side project. I loved building websites, but deep down, I didn’t truly believe it could become my *main job* or something that would carry me into the future. It was something I enjoyed, but it felt like “just a hobby” – something to do *alongside* other responsibilities, not something to fully lean into.

Fast forward to now, and the growth has been incredible:
- **Blogpost reads:** 30x increase
- **Instagram reach:** 16x increase
- **Income:** 15x increase
- **Projects completed:** 6x more than last year

More importantly than the numbers, though, is what this growth *means* to me.  
I now get to focus on work that aligns with my passion. I build websites for people whose work I genuinely care about and support – clients I *want* to help succeed. My processes are smoother, and I can prioritize the most important work without burning out.

The best part? I enjoy my work more than ever. I get to work remotely from anywhere I choose, and I’m building a business that feels fully aligned with my vision: **helping others bring their passion to life so they can focus on what’s meaningful to them**.

Is it enough to fully live off yet? Not quite – but if this growth continues, I’m confident it will be. And that’s an *incredibly* exciting thought. Knowing that this can work, that I can make this my main thing, motivates me to keep going and keep building.

Here’s the draft for **Part 2: Treating It Like a Real Business**:



### **2. Treating It Like a Real Business**

One of the biggest changes this year? I stopped treating my web development business like a hobby and started treating it as what it has the potential to become: my *main thing*.

Of course, I still have my university studies and a part-time job, both of which are important. But I made a conscious decision to treat my business as *equally important* – if not more so – and to put everything I’ve got into it.

Why? Because, honestly, I have *nothing to lose*.  
Worst case? It doesn’t work out, and I still learn *a ton*.  
Best case? It *does* work out, and I get to spend my time doing something I truly enjoy, am passionate about, and that aligns with my vision for a fulfilling life. A life where I consciously choose how I live and design my days according to my terms.

This mindset shift alone made a *huge difference*.  
Instead of waiting for the right time or perfect circumstances, I blocked time in my calendar and stuck to it. Thanks to my time-blocking system, I divide my weekly work hours roughly into three parts:
- **A third for university** (because my degree is important, too).
- **A third for my part-time job** (which keeps things stable).
- **A third for my business** (the thing I actively chose to prioritize and grow).

And outside of those "official" hours?  
I use car rides, walks, hikes, and even casual chats with friends or clients to brainstorm, educate myself, and stay inspired. This doesn’t just help my business – it benefits my overall well-being, confidence, and creativity.

Taking my business seriously has been *transformational*. It’s no longer just something I do on the side – it’s something I actively design my life around. Treating it like it *matters* made it matter even more, and slowly but surely, it’s becoming exactly what I envisioned.


### **3. Choosing My Channels and Staying Consistent**

At one point, I thought about trying podcasting too. But the more I considered it, the more I realized: blogging and Instagram just make way more sense for me.

For starters, I know my strengths. While I love the idea that you can learn anything, I also believe in playing to what comes naturally. Writing has always been my thing – I can express myself better and connect more clearly through words.

Instagram is a no-brainer too. Powerlifting coaches and athletes (aka my main niche) are super active there, so it’s the perfect place to share my work, connect with people, and also show some of my personal side (which I’ve realized is just as important).

And of course, as a web developer, my website has to be a reflection of what I can do. Over the past year, I’ve put a lot of work into making it a strong representation of both my professional skills and my personality. It’s where I can really showcase what makes me unique, share references, and send people to see exactly what I do. I’m proud of how it’s turned out – it’s my little digital home.

Consistency is the secret ingredient here. I post at least once a week – usually twice – and I make sure it’s regular. To keep everything running smoothly, I’ve built a system that works for me:
- A **Kanban board** keeps all my ideas and posts organized. I know exactly what’s in progress, what’s ready to go, and what’s still just an idea.
- I’ve created structured processes to brainstorm, draft, and schedule posts. Random ideas that pop into my head go straight into my notes, so I always have something ready when it’s time to create.

This approach has been such a game-changer. It’s helped me stay consistent, share content that feels meaningful, and position myself as approachable and passionate – not just about my work, but about connecting with others too.


### **4. Sharing the Personal Side – It’s Not Just About Work**

Another big change I made this year was integrating more of my personal side into my business content. I’ve always shared personal stuff – but only on my private Instagram account. This year, I brought that into my business account, my blog, and even my website.

I started showing things like:
- Where and how I work – whether it’s in cozy cafés, surrounded by nature, or on the go.
- My powerlifting journey, which is such a huge part of my live. 
- Small personal moments, like discovering the best vegan snacks or enjoying a great coffee.
- My vision and passion for the work I do.

Why? Because people connect with people, not just services. Sharing these parts of my life doesn’t just make my content more relatable – it makes my whole business feel more genuine.

This approach has helped me build deeper connections with clients. Many have told me they reached out because they saw my values and personality align with theirs. 
And it’s not just on Instagram or my blog; 
my website now reflects this personal touch too, both in content and design.
It’s not just about showcasing my work – it’s about showing who I am and what I stand for.

By sharing more of my personal side, I’ve created a business that’s not just a job – it’s a true reflection of me.


### **5. Supporting My Clients Beyond the Website**

This year, I made it a priority to show more of my clients and their amazing work. On my blog, Instagram, and even in casual conversations, I share not only the websites I create for them but also what they do – their businesses, their projects, their passions. These are things I genuinely love and want to support, so sharing them feels natural to me.

Why? Because I’m not just delivering a website. I want to see my clients succeed and know I’ve helped, even if just a little bit. Sharing their work helps them reach more people, builds stronger relationships, and lets them know I’m genuinely invested in their success. And it’s not just about them – it makes me happy too. When they thrive, I feel like I’ve contributed to something meaningful.

This also ties into another small, personal practice I started recently: sending handwritten and individually printed postcards to my clients after we’ve worked together. It’s a small gesture, but it means a lot to me. I truly appreciate their trust in me to support their vision, and taking the time to send a personal thank-you is one way to show that.

These thoughtful actions – sharing their work, sending postcards, and scheduling regular check-ins to make sure their websites continue to serve them well – are all part of what I call "over-delivering." I don’t just deliver the website and walk away. I go the extra mile to support them, building stronger relationships that bring happiness on both sides.

Over-delivering isn’t just about business; it’s about care. And in the long run, it always pays off – for them and for me. Stronger business relationships mean more referrals, returning clients, and, most importantly, a sense of fulfillment.


### **6. Regular R&D: Innovating, Testing, and Refining**

One of the most valuable lessons I’ve taken from my part-time job in Research & Development (R&D) is the importance of continuously testing, evaluating, and refining ideas. Applying this principle to my business has been a game-changer.

I’ve set up my own version of R&D, focusing on four core areas:
1. **Marketing:** Finding innovative ways to reach new clients and share my work.
2. **Services/Projects/Offerings:** Refining what I deliver to clients to add even more value.
3. **My Website:** Continuously improving how I represent myself online.
4. **Content and Content Strategy:** Enhancing the way I create, share, and structure content.

Every two weeks, I set aside time to reflect on what I’ve done so far in these areas. I evaluate what’s working, brainstorm new ideas to try, and decide which ones to prioritize next. Once I’ve chosen a focus, I break it down into actionable steps, set a (usually small) budget, and establish specific targets for measuring success.

#### **Prototyping New Ideas**
I like to think of this as “prototyping.” Instead of diving headfirst into a big, expensive plan, I start small, test the waters, and gather data. For example, one of my current marketing experiments is reaching startup and business-founding students through analog flyers placed at universities and startup meetups. My goal is to tap into a new niche and generate leads. The success of this idea is easy to track: I can measure it by the number of new clients or followers I gain directly from the flyers.

By starting small and evaluating results, I avoid wasting time and resources on strategies that don’t work, while doubling down on those that do. This keeps my business dynamic and ensures I’m always improving my processes, offerings, and overall approach.

#### **Tracking Key Metrics**
Another key part of R&D is deciding what to measure. While revenue is an important metric, I believe that in the earlier stages of a business, other data points can provide more actionable insights. For me, the metrics I track are:
- **Instagram Followers and Reach:** Instagram is one of my primary marketing platforms, so these numbers show how well my content is connecting.
- **Newly Interested Clients:** This tracks how many potential clients I’m reaching each week.
- **Client Ratings:** Happy clients are my top priority, and their feedback is invaluable for refining my work.

I review these metrics weekly, looking for trends over time. When I see improvements, I analyze what contributed to them and aim to replicate those strategies. If the numbers drop, I reflect on what could be done differently in the coming weeks.

By building R&D into my regular workflow, I ensure I stay adaptable, efficient, and focused. It’s a practice that not only drives innovation but also keeps my business aligned with my goals and values.
