Welcome to my personally curated list of book and podcast recommendations! 
This collection isn’t sorted by topic because many of these resources cross over into multiple areas, 
and I wanted to avoid repetition to keep things simple and engaging. 
While this list includes some well-known classics you might already be familiar with, 
it also features several hidden gems that have brought a lot of value to my life. 
Whether you’re looking for inspiration, education, or insights into new perspectives, 
I hope you find something here that resonates just as strongly with you. Enough talking, let's dive in!

    Quick side-note, if you want to get one of the books, you can support me by using the affiliate links I provide here.
    Thank you!

## The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People
***Stephen R. Covey***   
*[Get the book](https://www.amazon.de/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Anniversary/dp/1471195201?crid=1VI1CF08LP731&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.8hMeczPKcN60plqP0CwCJIxwJGfis_thxguLkJegI3EvTV6ttf5TrKGNvr13-IbkFozUju_M7HM3sZO6qteObLC6gFR0BLXw1Iz5E_RFA-akgbpBX98GPRevaE-iVVsz0lFlgUgLjKVZCRWxKQyvbc2gSIOud8cxTzOuR_vhuV0Yr11hQmWPt4Umn47-q0ywfksPkTc4uhnft8xPqa00XCLf8HUncDx8LfZ0gfg7wPM.otCRPqCIwXYdQORqGZDyrbxeT9LHUhl4lu2-he06P3g&dib_tag=se&keywords=7+habits+of+highly+effective+people&qid=1713100557&sprefix=7+ha,aps,151&sr=8-1&linkCode=sl1&tag=ps642-21&linkId=9b8b6f8526200dbb4740e26b02eeb932&language=de_DE&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)*  
This is currently my all-time favorite book in the personal development domain.
Covey's principle-centered approach offers solutions for personal and professional challenges 
and has profoundly influenced my own life. 
For good reason, I have the diagram representing the 7 habits hanging on my door! 
If you're looking to delve into just one book about personal change, this should be at the top of your list.

## The Cafe on the Edge of the World: A Story About the Meaning of Life
***John Strelecky***   
*[Get the book](https://amzn.to/3JlzH3v)*  
A quick read with a simple yet powerful message: 
finding what fulfills you and discovering your purpose can lead to a happier life. 
Although this concept might seem evident, many never pursue it. 
This book provides practical insights and inspiration to help you embark on that journey of self-discovery.

## Can't Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds
***David Goggins***   
*[Get the book](https://amzn.to/49BE9pe)*  
This book serves as a profound inspiration to push beyond your perceived limits and achieve what seems impossible. 
David Goggins' story is extreme, and while it isn’t a blueprint for everyone to follow exactly, 
the book makes that clear. What I love most is the blend of actionable tips and challenges 
mixed into Goggins' own life story. 
This book motivated me to challenge myself more than ever, and I'm excited about where this is taking me.

## 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos
***Jordan B. Peterson***   
*[Get the book](https://amzn.to/4cSXc1l)*  
This book has been a daily guide for me, not just a read. 
It presents a series of life principles that offer structure and understanding in a complex world. 
While there have been controversies around Peterson's personal conduct, 
the insights in the book can still offer valuable perspectives. 
I find the 12 rules so practical that I keep a summary of them on my door as a daily reminder.
