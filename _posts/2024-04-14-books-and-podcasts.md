Welcome to my personally curated list of book and podcast recommendations! 
This collection isn’t sorted by topic because many of these resources cross over into multiple areas, 
and I wanted to avoid repetition to keep things simple and engaging. 
While this list includes some well-known classics you might already be familiar with, 
it also features several hidden gems that have brought a lot of value to my life. 
Whether you’re looking for inspiration, education, or insights into new perspectives, 
I hope you find something here that resonates just as strongly with you. Enough talking, let's dive in! 

<div class="notice--info">
    Quick side-note, if you want to get one of the books, you can support me by using the affiliate links I provide here.
    Thank you!
</div>

<div class="notice--danger">
    Most of these books are available in English and German (and other languages), some sadly are not available in English.
    If that is the case, I clearly marked that!

and his approach resonates deeply with me. 
The philosophy is simple yet profound: make work, studying, and life as enjoyable as possible to 
maximize productivity in areas that truly matter to you. 
This book is packed with experiments, actionable tips, and personalized strategies to explore.
It’s evident that Ali takes his own advice, which I really appreciate.
I think no book ever contained more things that I directly and easily could (and did) start to apply to my own life.

*[Get the book](https://amzn.to/49BE9pe)*  
This book serves as a profound inspiration to push beyond your perceived limits and achieve what seems impossible. 
David Goggins' story is extreme, and while it isn’t a blueprint for everyone to follow exactly, 
the book makes that clear. What I love most is the blend of actionable tips and challenges 
mixed into Goggins' own life story. 
This book motivated me to challenge myself more than ever, and I'm excited about where this is taking me.

## 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos
***Jordan B. Peterson***   
*[Get the book](https://amzn.to/4cSXc1l)*  
This book has been a daily guide for me, not just a read. 
It presents a series of life principles that offer structure and understanding in a complex world. 
While there have been controversies around Peterson's personal conduct, 
the insights in the book can still offer valuable perspectives. 
I find the 12 rules so practical that I keep a summary of them on my door as a daily reminder.

Really digs into how small changes can make a big impact on our daily lives. 
The book is filled with practical strategies that helped me improve my positive routines and 
actually do break my bad habits.
I've found the tips so helpful that I've subscribed to Clear's email newsletter, 
which sends reminders and further advice every few days, which helps me to stick to the lessons I learned from the book.

The title translates as *"Three questions: Who am I? Where am I going? And with whom?"*.  
I love how Bucay gets straight to the point and gives helpful advice to answer these vital life questions.  
Even though I do not fully agree with all statements in the book, especially the first half of it
was quite transformative for me and had such a significant impact that I definitely wanted to include it in this list.

packed with insights on everything from negotiation and finance to leadership and operations management.

Despite its overtly salesy title and style of writing, which might be off-putting for some, 
this book provided me with unique insights that I haven't found elsewhere in such a comprehensive manner. 
If you're exploring marketing, this is definitely worth checking out. 
Look past the aggressive sales tone, and you'll discover a wealth of practical advice that goes beyond 
the basic marketing tips commonly found in videos and blog posts.

based on brain research. This book offers an in-depth look at the intersection of neuroscience and web design, 
providing both theoretical insights and practical advice. My clients and I have gained significant benefits 
from the approaches detailed in this book. If you’re interested in enhancing your website’s effectiveness 
through psychology, this is a must-read.

## Hello World: How to be Human in the Age of the Machine
***Hannah Fry***   
*[Get the book](https://amzn.to/4cXDeCt)*  
In the age of artificial intelligence (AI) and algorithms, pressing questions arise that we need to address. 
The book presents dilemmas such as 
*"You are accused of a crime. Who would you rather determined your fate - a human or a machine?"* and 
*"Which driverless car do you buy - one that prioritizes your life in the event of a crash or one 
that reacts to save as many lives as possible?"* 
These are not just theoretical questions; we are nearing a point where such decisions will become reality. 
This makes delving into the implications of AI and technology crucial, 
and Fry’s book provides an extremely valuable exploration of these topics.

the ethical considerations of these technologies become more pressing. 
From autonomous vehicles on our roads to robots in healthcare and algorithms making critical decisions, 
the scope of AI and robotics in our daily lives is ever-growing. 
This book offers an essential introduction to the ethics involved, 
presenting complex issues in an accessible manner without requiring prior expertise. 
It’s a great read for anyone interested in understanding the ethical landscape of modern technology.
