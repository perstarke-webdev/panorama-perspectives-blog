# **1 - Introduction: If I Had to Start Over…**

Starting out as a freelance web developer can feel overwhelming—I’ve been there. There are **so many things to figure out**: building a portfolio, finding clients, setting up a website, pricing your services, and actually **delivering great work**. And if you're not careful, you can get stuck **preparing forever**—convincing yourself you just need to "learn a little more" before taking action.

If I had to **start over today**, I’d do things differently.


### **The #1 Lesson: Don’t Just Prepare—Start Taking Action**

One of the biggest mistakes I see (and made myself) is **waiting for the perfect moment**. The truth is:
- You **won’t feel 100% ready** before you start.
- There’s **always more to learn** about tools, coding, and business.
- But **real growth happens through experience**—by actually working with clients, solving real problems, and adapting as you go.

If I started fresh today, I wouldn’t **spend months perfecting my skills in isolation**. Instead, I’d focus on **getting real projects as soon as possible**—even if they’re small or unpaid at first. Because the sooner you start working with actual clients, the faster you’ll learn **what really matters** in freelancing.


### **I’d Treat It Like a Real Business From Day One**

This means **taking myself seriously** right from the start:  
✅ Instead of saying, “I’m trying out freelancing,” I’d say, **“I’m building my freelance business.”** – both out loud and to myself. The way you talk about it **matters a lot!**  
✅ I wouldn’t treat it like a hobby—I’d **put in real effort** to get clients, manage finances, and build my reputation.  
✅ I’d make sure my **work reflects professionalism**, even if I’m just starting out.

This shift in **mindset changes everything**. When you treat your freelance work like a real business, others start treating it that way too—including potential clients.

For more on this mindset shift, see [How I 15x My Freelance Business in 2024 – and Transformed My Life Along the Way](/posts/how-i-grow-my-freelance-business)


### **I’d Work on Multiple Things at the Same Time** (Without Multitasking)

One mistake many beginners make is thinking they have to **finish one step before moving on to the next**—but in reality, you can make progress on **several things at once**:  
🚀 **While setting up my website, I’d already start reaching out to potential clients.**  
🚀 **While working on my first project, I’d start posting content and refining my online presence.**

Instead of multitasking (**a productivity and quality killer!**), I’d work in **focused sprints**:  
🕐 **A full day or week** focused on building my website.  
🕐 **A focused push** to do client outreach.  
🕐 **A few hours** to create content and engage with potential clients.

Then I’d **repeat the cycle**, keeping momentum without getting stuck on just one thing.


### **I’d Make My Work Fun and Enjoyable**

Freelancing is hard work—but I’d make sure to **enjoy the process**. When work feels fun, you:  
✅ Stay **more productive** without burning out.  
✅ Do **better quality work**, which leads to happier clients.  
✅ Leave a **positive impression** on everyone you interact with.

This is something I’ve written about before in my blog post on **[Feel-Good Productivity](/posts/feel-good-productivity)**—making work enjoyable actually makes you **better at it**. If I started over, I’d **build habits that make work energizing and rewarding**, so I could stay motivated and excited about freelancing.


It’s easy to get caught up in the pressure of "getting everything right." But at the end of the day, **the best way to grow a successful freelance business is to take action, keep learning, and enjoy the ride**.


### **Next Up: What I’d Focus on First**
Now that we’ve covered the **right mindset**, let’s dive into **exactly what I’d do first**—from setting up my portfolio to landing my first clients. 🚀


<hr>

# **2 - I Would Build a Foundation for Getting Clients**

Before I worried about getting paying clients, I’d make sure I had **a strong foundation**—something to show, a niche to focus on, and an online presence that made me easy to find.


### **I’d Make My Portfolio My First Priority**

Before I reached out to anyone, I’d make sure I had **something to show**. Clients don’t just want promises—they want proof. Here’s how I’d get that proof:

✅ **My first real project would be my own website.** This would be my chance to practice real development while creating a professional site that represents me. As a web developer, people will absolutely **judge me by my website**—so I’d make sure it’s clean, modern, and actually reflects my skills.

✅ **I’d showcase my skills with mock projects, open-source work, or early small jobs.** If I had no past clients yet, I wouldn’t let that stop me—I’d **create my own projects** to display.
- I’d **build and showcase mock projects**—for example, a landing page for a fictional startup or a sleek portfolio site.
- I’d **contribute to open-source**—fixing small issues, submitting pull requests, and adding my contributions to my portfolio.
- I’d **offer to do small free/discounted projects strategically**—only for **real businesses or organizations** that could provide me with references or connections.

✅ **I’d offer free or discounted work only strategically.** I wouldn’t make a habit of working for free. The goal would be to get **real references, testimonials, and practice**, not to stay stuck in unpaid work.

For a deeper dive into how I’d approach building my portfolio, see **[Finding Clients as a (Web Development) Freelancer #1 - Building a Strong Portfolio](/posts/finding-web-development-freelancing-clients-one#building-a-strong-portfolio)**.


### **I’d Define My Niche Without Overthinking It**

A big mistake beginners make is **trying to appeal to everyone**. I wouldn’t stress about picking the "perfect" niche—but I would absolutely define one.

✅ **I’d go for a small, specific niche.** Web development is **way too broad**—there are thousands of developers out there. But in a smaller niche, I could quickly become **the go-to person**.

✅ **I’d start with a niche I know well and where I already have connections.**  
For me, that would be **Powerlifting Coaches**—but I’d stay open to working with other **small businesses and coaches in related fields**.

✅ **I’d stay flexible.** I wouldn’t lock myself into one niche forever—I’d start somewhere, learn what works, and adapt as I go.

For more on how I’d find my niche, have a look at **[Finding Clients as a (Web Development) Freelancer #1 - Differentiate Your Services](/posts/finding-web-development-freelancing-clients-one#differentiate-your-services-from-others)**.


### **I’d Build a Simple Online Presence for Visibility**

Even if I wasn’t famous yet, I’d make sure I was at least **easy to find**.

✅ **I’d structure my website for SEO.**
- I’d make sure my website’s messaging was **clear and direct**.
- I’d build **backlinks** by adding my name and site to every project I worked on (as long as clients were okay with it).

✅ **I’d set up a simple, but effective [social media presence](https://www.instagram.com/per.starke).**
- I wouldn’t overcomplicate it—just a clean, professional profile that shows what I do.
- I’d pick **one or two platforms** (for me, Instagram, because that is where my niche is the most active and what best suits my own style, plus a blog for deeper dives) and focus on **consistency over perfection**.

✅ **I’d use content to position myself as an expert—but also as someone always learning.**
- I wouldn’t try to act like a “guru” with all the answers. Instead, I’d share **insights from my work** while showing that I’m always improving.
- This balance of **confidence + humility** makes people trust you more.


<hr>

# **3 - I Would Get My First Real Projects (Even If They Were Free)**

Even though I would have already worked on creating **some kind of portfolio** in the step above, **landing my first real clients would still be a big step**. Nothing replaces actual experience working with real people, solving their problems, and delivering results. That’s why I’d be **proactive**—I wouldn’t wait for opportunities, I’d go out and **find them myself**.

### **I’d Start With Friends, Family, and Local Businesses**

The easiest way to get my first projects? **Through people I already know.**  
✅ **I’d ask around:** Maybe my parents run a business that could use a better website? Maybe a friend knows someone looking for a site?  
✅ **I’d check local businesses:** A small restaurant, a gym, or a local shop might need a website—or have one that’s outdated. I’d walk in, **talk to the owner**, and offer to help.  
✅ **I’d make it easy for them to say yes:** Instead of making it sound like a huge commitment, I’d position it as, **“Hey, I’m just getting started and would love to build something great for you.”**

To make this **as risk-free as possible** for them, I’d include a **satisfaction guarantee** for everyone I talk to—whether paid or unpaid:  
✅ **Unlimited feedback rounds** until they are **fully satisfied**. No matter what, I’d keep improving the site until they truly love it.  
✅ **Money-back guarantee for paid projects.** If they’re not happy, they get their money back—no questions asked.

This would make it **a no-brainer** for them to say yes while also showing that I take their satisfaction **very seriously**.

### **I’d Be Very Selective With Free Work**

Doing **one or two free projects** can be a great way to gain experience—but I wouldn’t get stuck working for free. To keep it strategic, I’d set **clear rules**:  
✅ **1-3 free projects max.** Enough to build a portfolio and get testimonials, but not so many that I undervalue myself.  
✅ **Only for projects that give real value.** If I work for free, it needs to give me **portfolio material, referrals, or experience** I truly need.  
✅ **I’d treat these projects professionally.** Just because it’s free doesn’t mean it’s casual—I’d still go through a structured process and **deliver real results**.

### **I Wouldn’t Stay Stuck Doing Free Work**

The goal of these first projects is to **gain confidence, build a portfolio, and get my first paying clients**.  
🚀 **Once I had solid references, I’d start charging.** Even if it’s just a small amount at first, I’d move toward **paid work as quickly as possible**.  
🚀 **I’d leverage early clients for referrals.** I’d ask happy clients if they know anyone who needs a website—word-of-mouth is powerful.  
🚀 **I’d use my portfolio to start reaching out to new clients.** Once I had 1-3 solid projects to show, I’d start actively **pitching my services** to real paying clients.

Free work can be a **great starting point**, but I’d always keep the bigger goal in mind: **getting real, paying clients as soon as possible**.

<hr>


# **4 - I Would Define My Services Before Scaling Up**

Once I’d completed **a few projects**, I wouldn’t just keep saying yes to everything—I’d take a step back and **refine my offer**. This is something I wish I had done earlier. At the start, it’s tempting to say, **“I can build anything for anyone”**—but that leads to **confusion, inefficiency, and underpricing**.

Instead, I’d take what I learned from my first projects and **get clear on what I offer, how I price it, and how I communicate it**.

Check out my current [services page](https://perstarke-webdev.de/en/services) to see how I did that!

### **I’d Get Clear on My Services**

Rather than leaving things vague, I’d define **exactly what I offer**:  
✅ **Basic websites?** Simple, effective sites for small businesses.  
✅ **Custom builds?** More advanced projects for those who need unique features.  
✅ **Landing pages?** High-converting pages for businesses running ads or promotions.  
✅ **Ongoing support?** Monthly maintenance or updates for existing clients.

I wouldn’t **offer everything under the sun**—I’d focus on **what I enjoy doing** and **where I can provide the most value**.

### **I’d Set a Pricing Strategy**

Pricing is one of the hardest things to figure out as a freelancer—but I’d go in with a **clear plan**:  
💰 **Where I start:** I wouldn’t try to charge premium prices immediately, but I’d also avoid going too low. Instead, I’d price fairly for my experience level while ensuring my rates are sustainable.  
📈 **How I increase:** After every 3-5 projects, I’d review my pricing and adjust based on demand and experience. I wouldn’t stay stuck at beginner rates forever.  
🎯 **How flexible I want to be:** I’d decide in advance how much room I have for discounts, payment plans, or project-based flexibility—so I don’t make rushed decisions under pressure.

### **I’d Make My Services Easy to Understand**

Many freelancers overcomplicate their offers, making it hard for potential clients to see the value. I’d keep it **simple and clear**:  
✅ **No technical jargon**—I’d focus on benefits, not just features.  
✅ **Straightforward pricing tiers**—clear options, so clients know what fits their needs.  
✅ **Defined deliverables**—so there’s no confusion about what’s included.

For example, instead of saying:  
❌ *“I build custom web solutions with modular CMS integration and API connectivity.”*

I’d say:  
✅ **“I build modern, easy-to-manage websites that help businesses grow.”**

### **I’d Clearly Define What’s Included (and What’s Extra)**

One of the easiest ways to avoid **miscommunication** is to be **crystal clear** about what’s included in my services—and what isn’t. I’d specify things like:  
✅ **How many pages are included?** (E.g., "Up to 5 pages—additional pages at X€ each.")  
✅ **What level of customization?** (E.g., "Fully custom design vs. template-based.")

By doing this upfront, I’d **avoid misunderstandings**, **prevent scope creep**, and ensure clients know **exactly what they’re getting**.

### **I’d Clearly Communicate My Services Everywhere**

Once I’d defined my services, I’d make sure **they’re easy to find**:  
📌 **On my website**—A dedicated page explaining each service, its benefits, and who it’s for.  
📌 **On social media**—Simple posts breaking down my offers in a clear, engaging way.  
📌 **In my outreach messages**—So potential clients immediately understand what I do.

The clearer my services are, the **easier it is for clients to say yes**—and the smoother every project runs.

<hr> 

# **5 - I Would Fast-Track My First Paying Clients**

At this point, I’d have a **portfolio, clear services, and some real projects under my belt**—but the real game-changer would be **landing my first paying clients**. I wouldn’t sit around waiting for clients to find me. Instead, I’d take **immediate action** to bring them in.

### **I’d Use Direct Outreach Immediately**

Rather than hoping people stumble across my website, I’d go out and **actively find potential clients**—especially those who fit my niche.

#### **Where I’d Look for Clients**
✅ **Google Maps** – Searching for local businesses in my niche (e.g., strength coaches, gym owners, small businesses).  
✅ **Instagram & LinkedIn** – Finding people who are actively growing their brand but **don’t have a strong website presence yet**.  
✅ **Personal Network** – Revisiting **friends, family, or past contacts** who might know someone in need of a website.

Then, I’d send **personalized outreach messages** that feel natural and actually **start a conversation**—not generic spam.

#### **Real Outreach Example**

This is the kind of message I’d send to a powerlifting coach:

<div class="notice--info" Markdown="1"> 

Hey [Name],

Really sick numbers, **800kg at u100 and a WRPF AUS record**, that’s next level! 🔥 *[Referring to his profile bio]*

I’m a **competitive powerlifter from Germany** but currently studying abroad in Sydney. Last year, I spent a few weeks in Melbourne and trained at Doherty’s City Gym—absolutely **loved the vibe there!** Thinking about coming back later this year while I’m still in Australia. *[He trains there, I saw that at his posts]*

I also work as a **freelance web developer** and wanted to reach out and see if you’ve ever considered a **dedicated website for your coaching?** Something beyond Linktree that really **showcases your brand, coaching results, and makes it even easier for lifters to find and work with you.**

Would love to build something solid for you if you’re keen—**let me know!** Either way, keep smashing it! 💪

Cheers,  
Per

</div>

This message works because it:  
✅ Feels **genuine** and **personalized** (I reference their achievements and show shared interests).  
✅ Shows that I **understand their business** and their needs.  
✅ **Doesn’t pressure them**—just opens the conversation.

If they reply with interest, I’d follow up with **more details and a portfolio link** to move the conversation forward.

For more on this, dive into [Finding Clients as a (Web Development) Freelancer #2 - Direct Outreach](/posts/finding-web-development-freelancing-clients-two#direct-outreach-leveraging-your-portfolio-for-immediate-impact)


### **I’d Leverage Referrals Right Away**

The best way to turn **one client into many?** Get them to **recommend me to others**.

Rather than waiting for referrals to happen naturally, I’d **actively ask for them**—but in a way that feels natural, not pushy.

#### **My Go-To Closing Message for Clients**

Once I finish a project, I’d send a **friendly, appreciative message** that makes it easy for them to refer me:


<div class="notice--info" Markdown="1"> 

Hey [Client’s Name],

Just wanted to say **thank you again for the great collaboration!** I hope you’re super happy with your website. If anything ever needs tweaking or if you have questions, **just reach out anytime—I’m always here to help!**

A couple of quick things:

✅ **Can I feature your website in my references and share it on Instagram?** If yes, that would be awesome—if not, no worries at all!  
✅ **Who do you know that might also need a website?** I’d love it if you could recommend me—it’s always the best way for me to grow! :)  
✅ **If you found our collaboration helpful, a Google Maps review would mean a lot.** Here’s the link: [Google Review Link]

Also, I’d really appreciate **any feedback**—whether it’s something you loved or things I could improve. Always looking to get better!

Thanks again, and looking forward to staying in touch! 🚀

Cheers,  
**Per**

</div>

This works because it:  
✅ **Shows appreciation** rather than just asking for a favor.  
✅ **Gives them options**—referrals, reviews, and feedback—all valuable to me.  
✅ **Keeps it casual**—no pressure, just a natural way to help me out.

# **6 - I Would Make My First Clients as Happy as Possible**

Happy clients lead to **more referrals, more trust, a stronger reputation**—and, most importantly, **more fulfilling work**.

This isn’t just about delivering a great website—it’s about **creating an experience that people remember and appreciate**. Here’s exactly how I’d make sure my first clients don’t just like my work but **love working with me**:

### **I’d Deliver Great Work—But I’d Also Focus on the Experience**
Freelancing isn’t just about the final product. A client might love their website, but if the process was **stressful, frustrating, or unclear**, they won’t recommend me to others.

So, I’d make sure that:  
✅ **Communication is clear and smooth**—no guessing what happens next.  
✅ **The process feels effortless**—I’d guide them through everything.  
✅ **Every step is transparent**—so they always know what’s going on.

### **I’d Be Friendly, Proactive, and Easy to Work With**
People don’t just hire **skills**—they hire **people**. I’d make sure that every client enjoys working with me by:  
✅ **Being approachable and easygoing.**  
✅ **Responding quickly** to messages and questions.  
✅ **Taking initiative**—not waiting for them to ask, but anticipating what they need.

If a client enjoys the process, they’ll not only **come back for future work** but also **recommend me to others**.

### **I’d Celebrate Their Successes**
For many clients, launching a website is a **huge milestone**—so I’d make sure to celebrate with them!  
🎉 **A launch message**: Congratulating them on their new website and sharing their excitement.  
📢 **Share a personal behind-the-scenes photo**: "Me working on the final steps of getting your website ready - excited for the launch!" or something along those lines.

Making clients **feel valued** turns them into **loyal advocates** for my business.

### **I’d Do Small Personal Gestures That Make Them Smile**
It’s the **little things** that make a big difference. I’d make sure to:  
💌 **Send a thank-you message** at the end of every project.  
📸 **Give them a social media mention**, boosting their business if they’re open to it.  
📬 **Surprise them with a thank-you postcard**—a simple, personal touch that makes an impact.

Clients appreciate **thoughtfulness**—it makes them **remember me** and **refer me** more often.

### **I’d Stay in Touch After the Project**
Many freelancers disappear after a project—but I’d make sure to **stay connected**.

✅ **I’d schedule a check-in** after a few months to see how things are going.  
✅ **I’d remind them that I’m available for updates, changes, or new projects.**  
✅ **I’d casually ask if they know anyone who might need a website.**

This keeps relationships **warm and active**, leading to **repeat business and referrals**—without feeling salesy or pushy.

### **Making Clients Happy = Building a Business That Grows on Its Own**
When clients love the experience, they **talk about it**. They **refer me** without me even asking. And that’s how I’d set myself up for **long-term success**—by not just delivering great work, but making every client **genuinely happy they worked with me**. 🚀

# **7 - I Would Avoid These Common Beginner Mistakes**

Starting out, it’s easy to focus on the wrong things—spending time on **what feels productive** instead of what **actually brings results**. If I had to start over, here’s what I’d **avoid** so I could **move faster and get real clients sooner**.

### **I Wouldn’t Rely on Freelance Platforms**
Platforms like Upwork and Fiverr **seem** like an easy way to get started—but they’re usually a **race to the bottom** in terms of pricing and competition.

🚫 **Low pay**: Clients expect cheap work, making it hard to charge sustainable rates.  
🚫 **High competition**: You’re competing against thousands of freelancers, often from lower-cost regions.  
🚫 **No control**: The platform sets the rules, takes a cut, and can suspend accounts randomly.

There **are** cases where freelance platforms can work—like if you offer a **high-value, niche service** (e.g., AI automation, complex web apps) and **position yourself strategically**. But for general web development? **I wouldn’t waste time there.**

🔗 [Finding Clients as a (Web Development) Freelancer #2 - Navigating Freelance Platforms](/posts/finding-web-development-freelancing-clients-two#navigating-freelance-platforms)

### **I Wouldn’t Waste Time on Branding & Social Media**
Many beginners spend **months** tweaking their logo, refining color palettes, and posting “perfect” content—without ever talking to potential clients. **I wouldn’t make that mistake.**

✅ **I’d focus on real client work first.** My website and online presence would be simple but professional—just enough to show my skills and personality.  
✅ **I’d use social media strategically.** I wouldn’t try to build a big audience first—I’d use it as a credibility tool while focusing on direct outreach.  
✅ **I’d avoid overcomplicating my brand.** Clients don’t hire you because of a perfect logo—they hire you because they **trust** you can solve their problem.

### **I Wouldn’t Try to Seem Like a Big Business**
Some beginners think they need to look like a **large agency** to get clients—but that’s often **a mistake**.

**Instead of being overly corporate and impersonal, I’d:**  
💡 Show both my **professional side** and my **personal side**—so potential clients feel like they **know me.**  
💡 Make my messaging **clear, direct, and human**—not overly formal or robotic.  
💡 Position myself as **a skilled individual**, not just another generic web agency.

People **hire people they connect with**—and in freelancing, **being personal and relatable is a strength, not a weakness.**

### **Focus on What Actually Moves the Needle**
At the start, I’d **cut out distractions** and focus on **the essentials**:  
✔️ Building a **solid foundation** (portfolio, clear services, online presence).  
✔️ Actively **reaching out** and talking to potential clients.  
✔️ Delivering **great work** and making clients **happy**.

Everything else? **It can come later.**

<hr>

# **8 - The Key Mindset: Start Small, Learn Fast, Keep Moving**

At the end of the day, **mindset is everything**. Freelancing isn’t just about building websites—it’s about **building a business**, growing your skills, and staying **consistent**. If I started over today, I’d adopt this mindset from day one:

### **Momentum > Perfection**
I wouldn’t get stuck overplanning or waiting for the “perfect” time to start. Instead, I’d **take action** and improve as I go.

🚀 **I wouldn’t try to master everything before starting**—real learning happens by doing.  
🚀 **I wouldn’t wait until my portfolio is “perfect”**—I’d start reaching out to clients as soon as I have **something to show**.  
🚀 **I wouldn’t overthink my niche or services**—I’d refine them based on actual projects and experience.

Progress beats perfection **every time**.

### **Small Projects → Real Experience → Bigger Opportunities**
Big opportunities don’t come out of nowhere—they **grow from smaller ones**.

💡 My **first project** might not be huge, but it would teach me valuable lessons.  
💡 My **second and third projects** would give me confidence, testimonials, and real experience.  
💡 Over time, those small wins would lead to **bigger, higher-paying opportunities**.

The fastest way to **get better, build trust, and attract more clients** is to **start now and keep improving.**

### **I’d Balance Client Work, Learning, and Business Growth**
Freelancing isn’t just about **doing the work**—it’s also about **growing your skills and business at the same time**.

🕐 I’d balance **client work** with learning new skills and improving my services.  
🕐 I’d set aside time for **business growth**—whether that’s marketing, refining my process, or improving my portfolio.  
🕐 I’d keep **iterating and adjusting** based on what’s working.

Freelancing is **a long game**, and I’d make sure I was always moving forward.

### **No Client? No Excuse—There’s Always Something to Improve**
If I didn’t have an active project, I wouldn’t just wait for work to come in—I’d use that time to **make my business stronger.**

✅ I’d refine my **website** and update my portfolio.  
✅ I’d create **content** to position myself as an expert.  
✅ I’d **reach out to new potential clients**—because clients won’t come to me if I don’t put myself out there.  
✅ I’d work on **learning and improving**—so that when the next opportunity comes, I’m ready.

This mindset—**always moving forward, always improving**—is what separates freelancers who struggle from those who build **a thriving business.**

Freelancing is **a journey**, and if I started over today, I’d embrace the process, keep learning, and enjoy every step of the way. 🚀
