## **Introduction: If I Had to Start Over…**

Starting out as a freelance web developer can feel overwhelming—I’ve been there. There are **so many things to figure out**: building a portfolio, finding clients, setting up a website, pricing your services, and actually **delivering great work**. And if you're not careful, you can get stuck **preparing forever**—convincing yourself you just need to "learn a little more" before taking action.

If I had to **start over today**, I’d do things differently.


### **The #1 Lesson: Don’t Just Prepare—Start Taking Action**

One of the biggest mistakes I see (and made myself) is **waiting for the perfect moment**. The truth is:
- You **won’t feel 100% ready** before you start.
- There’s **always more to learn** about tools, coding, and business.
- But **real growth happens through experience**—by actually working with clients, solving real problems, and adapting as you go.

If I started fresh today, I wouldn’t **spend months perfecting my skills in isolation**. Instead, I’d focus on **getting real projects as soon as possible**—even if they’re small or unpaid at first. Because the sooner you start working with actual clients, the faster you’ll learn **what really matters** in freelancing.


### **I’d Treat It Like a Real Business From Day One**

This means **taking myself seriously** right from the start:  
✅ Instead of saying, “I’m trying out freelancing,” I’d say, **“I’m building my freelance business.”** – both out loud and to myself. The way you talk about it **matters a lot!**  
✅ I wouldn’t treat it like a hobby—I’d **put in real effort** to get clients, manage finances, and build my reputation.  
✅ I’d make sure my **work reflects professionalism**, even if I’m just starting out.

This shift in **mindset changes everything**. When you treat your freelance work like a real business, others start treating it that way too—including potential clients.


### **I’d Work on Multiple Things at the Same Time** (Without Multitasking)

One mistake many beginners make is thinking they have to **finish one step before moving on to the next**—but in reality, you can make progress on **several things at once**:  
🚀 **While setting up my website, I’d already start reaching out to potential clients.**  
🚀 **While working on my first project, I’d start posting content and refining my online presence.**

Instead of multitasking (**a productivity and quality killer!**), I’d work in **focused sprints**:  
🕐 **A full day or week** focused on building my website.  
🕐 **A focused push** to do client outreach.  
🕐 **A few hours** to create content and engage with potential clients.

Then I’d **repeat the cycle**, keeping momentum without getting stuck on just one thing.


### **I’d Make My Work Fun and Enjoyable**

Freelancing is hard work—but I’d make sure to **enjoy the process**. When work feels fun, you:  
✅ Stay **more productive** without burning out.  
✅ Do **better quality work**, which leads to happier clients.  
✅ Leave a **positive impression** on everyone you interact with.

This is something I’ve written about before in my blog post on **[Feel-Good Productivity](https://blog.perstarke-webdev.de/posts/feel-good-productivity)**—making work enjoyable actually makes you **better at it**. If I started over, I’d **build habits that make work energizing and rewarding**, so I could stay motivated and excited about freelancing.


It’s easy to get caught up in the pressure of "getting everything right." But at the end of the day, **the best way to grow a successful freelance business is to take action, keep learning, and enjoy the ride**.


### **Next Up: What I’d Focus on First**
Now that we’ve covered the **right mindset**, let’s dive into **exactly what I’d do first**—from setting up my portfolio to landing my first clients. 🚀


<hr>

## **I Would Build a Foundation for Getting Clients**

Before I worried about getting paying clients, I’d make sure I had **a strong foundation**—something to show, a niche to focus on, and an online presence that made me easy to find.


### **I’d Make My Portfolio My First Priority**

Before I reached out to anyone, I’d make sure I had **something to show**. Clients don’t just want promises—they want proof. Here’s how I’d get that proof:

✅ **My first real project would be my own website.** This would be my chance to practice real development while creating a professional site that represents me. As a web developer, people will absolutely **judge me by my website**—so I’d make sure it’s clean, modern, and actually reflects my skills.

✅ **I’d showcase my skills with mock projects, open-source work, or early small jobs.** If I had no past clients yet, I wouldn’t let that stop me—I’d **create my own projects** to display.
- I’d **build and showcase mock projects**—for example, a landing page for a fictional startup or a sleek portfolio site.
- I’d **contribute to open-source**—fixing small issues, submitting pull requests, and adding my contributions to my portfolio.
- I’d **offer to do small free/discounted projects strategically**—only for **real businesses or organizations** that could provide me with references or connections.

✅ **I’d offer free or discounted work only strategically.** I wouldn’t make a habit of working for free. The goal would be to get **real references, testimonials, and practice**, not to stay stuck in unpaid work.

For a deeper dive into how I’d approach building my portfolio, see **[Finding Clients #1](#)**.


### **I’d Define My Niche Without Overthinking It**

A big mistake beginners make is **trying to appeal to everyone**. I wouldn’t stress about picking the "perfect" niche—but I would absolutely define one.

✅ **I’d go for a small, specific niche.** Web development is **way too broad**—there are thousands of developers out there. But in a smaller niche, I could quickly become **the go-to person**.

✅ **I’d start with a niche I know well and where I already have connections.**  
For me, that would be **Powerlifting Coaches**—but I’d stay open to working with other **small businesses and coaches in related fields**.

✅ **I’d stay flexible.** I wouldn’t lock myself into one niche forever—I’d start somewhere, learn what works, and adapt as I go.

For more on how I’d find my niche, have a look at **[Finding Clients #1 – Differentiating Your Services](#)**.


### **I’d Build a Simple Online Presence for Visibility**

Even if I wasn’t famous yet, I’d make sure I was at least **easy to find**.

✅ **I’d structure my website for SEO.**
- I’d make sure my website’s messaging was **clear and direct**.
- I’d build **backlinks** by adding my name and site to every project I worked on (as long as clients were okay with it).

✅ **I’d set up a simple, but effective social media presence.**
- I wouldn’t overcomplicate it—just a clean, professional profile that shows what I do.
- I’d pick **one or two platforms** (for me, Instagram, because that is where my niche is the most active and what best suits my own style, plus a blog for deeper dives) and focus on **consistency over perfection**.

✅ **I’d use content to position myself as an expert—but also as someone always learning.**
- I wouldn’t try to act like a “guru” with all the answers. Instead, I’d share **insights from my work** while showing that I’m always improving.
- This balance of **confidence + humility** makes people trust you more.

### **Next Up: How I’d Get My First Paying Clients**

Once I had a solid foundation, I wouldn’t wait around—I’d start **actively reaching out** to get real, paying clients. In the next section, I’ll share **exactly how I’d do that**. 🚀

<hr>

## **I Would Get My First Real Projects (Even If They Were Free)**

Even though I would have already worked on creating **some kind of portfolio** in the step above, **landing my first real clients would still be a big step**. Nothing replaces actual experience working with real people, solving their problems, and delivering results. That’s why I’d be **proactive**—I wouldn’t wait for opportunities, I’d go out and **find them myself**.

### **I’d Start With Friends, Family, and Local Businesses**

The easiest way to get my first projects? **Through people I already know.**  
✅ **I’d ask around:** Maybe my parents run a business that could use a better website? Maybe a friend knows someone looking for a site?  
✅ **I’d check local businesses:** A small restaurant, a gym, or a local shop might need a website—or have one that’s outdated. I’d walk in, **talk to the owner**, and offer to help.  
✅ **I’d make it easy for them to say yes:** Instead of making it sound like a huge commitment, I’d position it as, **“Hey, I’m just getting started and would love to build something great for you.”**

To make this **as risk-free as possible** for them, I’d include a **satisfaction guarantee** for everyone I talk to—whether paid or unpaid:  
✅ **Unlimited feedback rounds** until they are **fully satisfied**. No matter what, I’d keep improving the site until they truly love it.  
✅ **Money-back guarantee for paid projects.** If they’re not happy, they get their money back—no questions asked.

This would make it **a no-brainer** for them to say yes while also showing that I take their satisfaction **very seriously**.

### **I’d Be Very Selective With Free Work**

Doing **one or two free projects** can be a great way to gain experience—but I wouldn’t get stuck working for free. To keep it strategic, I’d set **clear rules**:  
✅ **1-3 free projects max.** Enough to build a portfolio and get testimonials, but not so many that I undervalue myself.  
✅ **Only for projects that give real value.** If I work for free, it needs to give me **portfolio material, referrals, or experience** I truly need.  
✅ **I’d treat these projects professionally.** Just because it’s free doesn’t mean it’s casual—I’d still go through a structured process and **deliver real results**.

### **I Wouldn’t Stay Stuck Doing Free Work**

The goal of these first projects is to **gain confidence, build a portfolio, and get my first paying clients**.  
🚀 **Once I had solid references, I’d start charging.** Even if it’s just a small amount at first, I’d move toward **paid work as quickly as possible**.  
🚀 **I’d leverage early clients for referrals.** I’d ask happy clients if they know anyone who needs a website—word-of-mouth is powerful.  
🚀 **I’d use my portfolio to start reaching out to new clients.** Once I had 1-3 solid projects to show, I’d start actively **pitching my services** to real paying clients.

Free work can be a **great starting point**, but I’d always keep the bigger goal in mind: **getting real, paying clients as soon as possible**.

### **Next Up: I Would Define My Services Before Scaling Up**

With my first projects done, I’d **take a step back** before rushing into more client work. Instead of saying yes to **every project that comes my way**, I’d start **defining what I actually offer**—so I can build a business that’s profitable, efficient, and enjoyable. 🚀


<hr>


## **I Would Define My Services Before Scaling Up**

Once I’d completed **a few projects**, I wouldn’t just keep saying yes to everything—I’d take a step back and **refine my offer**. This is something I wish I had done earlier. At the start, it’s tempting to say, **“I can build anything for anyone”**—but that leads to **confusion, inefficiency, and underpricing**.

Instead, I’d take what I learned from my first projects and **get clear on what I offer, how I price it, and how I communicate it**.

### **I’d Get Clear on My Services**

Rather than leaving things vague, I’d define **exactly what I offer**:  
✅ **Basic websites?** Simple, effective sites for small businesses.  
✅ **Custom builds?** More advanced projects for those who need unique features.  
✅ **Landing pages?** High-converting pages for businesses running ads or promotions.  
✅ **Ongoing support?** Monthly maintenance or updates for existing clients.

I wouldn’t **offer everything under the sun**—I’d focus on **what I enjoy doing** and **where I can provide the most value**.

### **I’d Set a Pricing Strategy**

Pricing is one of the hardest things to figure out as a freelancer—but I’d go in with a **clear plan**:  
💰 **Where I start:** I wouldn’t try to charge premium prices immediately, but I’d also avoid going too low. Instead, I’d price fairly for my experience level while ensuring my rates are sustainable.  
📈 **How I increase:** After every 3-5 projects, I’d review my pricing and adjust based on demand and experience. I wouldn’t stay stuck at beginner rates forever.  
🎯 **How flexible I want to be:** I’d decide in advance how much room I have for discounts, payment plans, or project-based flexibility—so I don’t make rushed decisions under pressure.

### **I’d Make My Services Easy to Understand**

Many freelancers overcomplicate their offers, making it hard for potential clients to see the value. I’d keep it **simple and clear**:  
✅ **No technical jargon**—I’d focus on benefits, not just features.  
✅ **Straightforward pricing tiers**—clear options, so clients know what fits their needs.  
✅ **Defined deliverables**—so there’s no confusion about what’s included.

For example, instead of saying:  
❌ *“I build custom web solutions with modular CMS integration and API connectivity.”*

I’d say:  
✅ **“I build modern, easy-to-manage websites that help businesses grow.”**

### **I’d Clearly Define What’s Included (and What’s Extra)**

One of the easiest ways to avoid **miscommunication** is to be **crystal clear** about what’s included in my services—and what isn’t. I’d specify things like:  
✅ **How many pages are included?** (E.g., "Up to 5 pages—additional pages at X€ each.")  
✅ **What level of customization?** (E.g., "Fully custom design vs. template-based.")

By doing this upfront, I’d **avoid misunderstandings**, **prevent scope creep**, and ensure clients know **exactly what they’re getting**.

### **I’d Clearly Communicate My Services Everywhere**

Once I’d defined my services, I’d make sure **they’re easy to find**:  
📌 **On my website**—A dedicated page explaining each service, its benefits, and who it’s for.  
📌 **On social media**—Simple posts breaking down my offers in a clear, engaging way.  
📌 **In my outreach messages**—So potential clients immediately understand what I do.

The clearer my services are, the **easier it is for clients to say yes**—and the smoother every project runs.

### **Next Up: I Would Get My First Paying Clients**

With a strong foundation in place, it’s time to **get serious about bringing in paid work**—no more free projects. Next, I’d focus on **turning my portfolio, services, and outreach into real income**. 🚀
