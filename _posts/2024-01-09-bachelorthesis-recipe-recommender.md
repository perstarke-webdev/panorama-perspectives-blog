## Summary

My bachelor thesis investigated the effectiveness of algorithms for personalized recipe recommendations. 
The research tested whether _collaborative filtering_ or _content-based_ approaches yield more satisfying results in terms of matching users' taste. 
To achieve this, a software application was developed, implementing both _ItemKNN_ and _content-based algorithm_,allowing for a direct comparison of their recommendation outcomes.

The evaluation of these algorithms was performed using a database containing more than 1000 recipes plus recommendation and rating information
. 
The results obtained from this software provided valuable insights into the effectiveness of both algorithms in the context of recipe recommendations. 

>Analyzing these results revealed a statistically significant difference in user ratings, with the ItemKNN algorithm receiving higher average ratings (4.2 out of 5 stars) compared to the content-based algorithm (3.389 stars). 
>This suggests that, on average, users found the recommendations provided by the ItemKNN algorithm more appealing and satisfying
>The study thus underlines the effectiveness of collaborative filtering approaches in the context of personalized recipe recommendations.

Thanx to Prof. Tobias Thelen and the University of Osnabr√ºck for supporting this work.

## Software architecture

The architecture of the Recipe Recommender system was documented with parts of the
[arc42 software architecture documentation template](https://arc42.org/).  

I used the [arc42 Architecture Communication Canvas](https://canvas.arc42.org/architecture-communication-canvas)
to give a brief overview of the software architecture.  
The canvas for the Recipe Recommender can be found below.  
More details can be found here soon.
