**How can I support my clients even better?** Thatâ€™s the question Iâ€™ve been asking myself lately. Building great websites is one thingâ€”I absolutely love helping my clients bring their visions to life online. But I started wondering: *What else could I do to make a bigger, lasting impact on their businesses and lives?*

Thatâ€™s when I thought about **networking**. Over the past year, building my own network has been a game-changer (you can read all about that in [my last post on how I grew my freelance business by 15x in 2024](/posts/how-i-grow-my-freelance-business#9-the-power-of-networking)). Itâ€™s helped me grow, connect, and thriveâ€”not just in business, but personally, too. And I realized: *What if I could help my clients experience the same thing?*

Thatâ€™s how the idea of an **online community** was born. It could be a space to:
- Build networks of like-minded people.
- Access helpful resources and tools.
- Share challenges, ideas, and wins with others who "get it."

Itâ€™s a massive projectâ€”exciting, but also a little overwhelming! There are so many steps to take, and itâ€™ll definitely take time. But Iâ€™m thrilled to get started, and I want to **share the entire journey** with youâ€”the challenges, the visions, the wins, and even the hurdles along the way.


### **How It Started**

To get this off the ground, I started where I often do: with **random brainstorming sessions**. Whether I was walking, waiting in line at the supermarket, or driving, I kept talking my ideas out loud, recording them with [Voicepal](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/voicepal-your-ai-ghostwriter/id6471552007) (not sponsored to say this, but seriously, a lifesaver for capturing all those scattered thoughts).

These brainstorming sessions helped me come up with hundreds of ideasâ€”how the community could be set up, what it could offer, what steps are needed, and so much more. It was chaotic, but exciting. And with all these thoughts flying around, I needed a way to **organize everything**.

Thatâ€™s where my **Miro board** came in (screenshot below!). Itâ€™s now the hub for all my ideasâ€”a place to map out the vision, jot down steps, and keep everything in one place to revisit as the project unfolds.

### **The First Steps**

With so many ideas, I knew I needed to narrow things down. My first step? **Defining the value.** What would this community actually offer? What would make it meaningful for my clients? See below for more info on that!

Next, I came up with a **(placeholder!) name**: *Balanced Business Community.* Itâ€™s not final, but itâ€™s enough to start getting feedback. I also decided to reach out to my past clients to validate the idea. Their input will help shape what this community becomes and ensure it truly serves their needs.


### **Join the Journey**

This is just the beginning of a long and exciting project, and Iâ€™d love for you to follow along.
