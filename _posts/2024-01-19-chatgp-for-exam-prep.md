I recenly had an extremely important oral exam, the last thing I needed to finally finish my bachelor degree! 
This exam covered way more topics than any exam I had before, partly from lectures I've had 3 years ago, so I needed to come up with a solution how I could effectively prepare - and came up with an unlikely ally: ChatGPT.  
In this post, I'll share how I utilized ChatGPT to prepare for my exam effectively and how it can help you as well.  

## Introduction

As a student, preparing for exams often seems like a mountain to climb. However, my approach changed dramatically when I decided to use ChatGPT for my recent oral exam preparation. Here's how it unfolded.

## Key Realizations

Before diving into the methods, it's crucial to understand two things:

1. **Time Investment is Essential**: Using ChatGPT doesn't reduce the amount of time you need to put into studying. It's a tool, not a shortcut.
2. **Accuracy Check**: ChatGPT, like any AI, can make mistakes. Always cross-check the information provided.

## Why ChatGPT?

I opted for the Pro-Version of ChatGPT (and I'm not sponsored to say this). It's a game-changer for studying, especially for my specific methods.
For example the possibility to upload files like lecture slides offers amazing opportunities which are very helpful for exam preparation. 

## Tailoring ChatGPT for My Exam

### Exam Details and Customization
How exactly you study of course depends on your exam type and the topics. I will explain what I did, but you might customize this approach to suit your own needs.  
- **Exam Type**: Oral exam, focused solely on questions.
- **No Access to Mock Exams**: I had no prior samples or mock exams to practice with.

### Setting Up ChatGPT for Studying
ChatGPT pro allows you to create your own GPT version, which you can provide with individual information and instructions.
So:
- I created a custom GPT especially for this exam prep.
- I provided it with details about the exam, such as the type of exam and type of exam tasks as well as the general topic.
- I instructed the GPT to summarize information in a detailed and correct, but also engaging, and fun manner. This can make memorizing things and staying focussed way easier.

## My Study Approach

### Focused Environment

- **Distraction-Free**: I put my Phone in a different room (or in my backpack when I was in caf√©s or so.)
- **Mindset**: Approaching studying as an adventure rather than a task. Sounds weird at first, but really helps!
- **Fun Elements**: Asking ChatGPT for engaging summaries with examples, probably listening to music if that doesn't distract you too much (depends on the type of music and also a lot on your liking), and changing study environments.
- **Work-Break Ratio**: 25-50 minutes of work followed by a 5-10 minute break. (Looking at your phone is NOT A BREAK! Trust me. Your brain can't relax well while looking at your phone.)

### Lecture Recap with ChatGPT

- **Uploading Lecture Slides**: Each lecture slide was uploaded to ChatGPT for a summary.
- **Accuracy Check**: I compared ChatGPT's summaries with the original slides and internet research to correct any misinformation.
- **Consolidated Review**: After covering a few lectures, I recapped everything studied so far.
- **Interactive Learning**: Utilized questions generated by ChatGPT after each lecture part.

### Practice Sessions

- **Generating Exam Questions**: I asked ChatGPT for potential exam questions.
- **Written Responses**: I wrote my answers and let ChatGPT review them, providing suggestions.
- **Randomized Order**: I didn't follow a set order in topics to keep the practice unpredictable.

### Understanding Concepts

- **Simplified Explanations**: Initially, I asked for explanations in simpler terms.
- **Gradual Complexity**: Once I grasped the basics, I requested more technical and detailed explanations.

## Conclusion

My experience with ChatGPT for exam preparation has been overwhelmingly positive. It changed my study habits for the better and made learning more engaging and efficient. If you're considering using AI for your studies, I highly recommend giving it a try!

Remember, the success of such a method depends on how well you can integrate the tool into your study routine and the effort you are willing to put in. Happy studying!
