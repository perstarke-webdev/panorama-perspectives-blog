[In my last post](/posts/building-an-online-community-1), I shared the **vision** for my Balanced Business Community—a space for freelancers and small business owners to connect, grow, and thrive together. It’s a big project, but one I’m incredibly excited about. Since then, I’ve been diving into the next steps: validating the idea, refining the concept, and taking those first tangible actions to bring it to life.

Here’s where I’m at so far:

### Validation: Testing the Waters

To make sure this idea truly resonates, I started reaching out to potential members. My approach was simple but effective:
- **Facebook groups and Reddit:** Joining discussions where freelancers and small business owners hang out.
- **Instagram polls and stories:** Using my platform to ask for feedback.
- **Past clients and personal contacts:** Sharing the vision directly with people I thought would benefit most.

The feedback was mixed but insightful. While some people weren’t sure if they’d join, others were genuinely excited. Hearing things like, *“This sounds amazing! Let me know when it’s live,”* confirmed I was onto something.

A big takeaway? This community doesn’t have to appeal to everyone—it just needs to bring value to the right people.

### Refining the Vision: First Ideas & the Landing Page

With initial feedback in hand, I set to work organizing my ideas and creating something more concrete: a **landing page**. This page outlines the community’s mission, its key benefits, and what potential members can expect.
It's also a "playground" for me to just note down what I want to create in a structured way.

Creating the page not only helped me communicate the concept more clearly, but it also gave me a tool to gather **early interest**. People can sign up for my newsletter to stay updated—and every new signup feels like a small step closer to making this vision a reality.

### An Exciting First Step: Planning the Expert Talk

One of the most exciting developments so far? My therapist and coach, **Jack**, has offered to give a free expert talk as part of the community’s early promotion.

Jack has been a huge part of my own growth—personally, professionally, and even in my training. Over the past year, his guidance has helped me build healthier habits, stay focused, and find balance.

His talk will most likely focus on **mental health and balanced, successful work as a freelancer or business founder**—a topic I think will resonate deeply with many potential community members. It’ll be a mix of a short presentation and Q&A, making it interactive and practical.
I am currently planning more details on that and validating the talk idea as well - if you are interested in joining (for free!), just [contact me to let me know](https://perstarke-webdev.de/en/contact)! 

This first event feels like the perfect way to kick off the community and start building value from the very beginning.

### What’s Next

With validation underway, a landing page live, and plans for the first expert talk taking shape, the pieces are starting to come together. There’s still so much to do, but I’m excited to keep moving forward—and to share the process with you along the way.

If you’re curious about what’s next, or if you’d like to help shape the community, **join my newsletter [here](https://perstarke-webdev.de/en/newsletter-signup)**. I’d love to have you along for the journey! 🚀
