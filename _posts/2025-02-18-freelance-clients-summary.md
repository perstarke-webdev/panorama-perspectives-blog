In today's post, I'm excited to share strategies and tips that have significantly boosted my freelance career.
These insights are tailored for web developers but are equally beneficial for freelancers across various fields.
So, whether you're coding websites or do any other freelancing work, stick around for some universal freelance wisdom.


## 1: Build a Strong Foundation & Portfolio

Before you even think about landing clients, you need something to **prove you can deliver**. No one hires a freelancer without seeing proof.

### ✅ Step 1: Get a Portfolio—Even If You Have No Clients
Freelancing’s classic catch-22: *You need a portfolio to get work, and work to build a portfolio.*  
Here’s how to break the loop:

- **Your Own Website** (a must for web devs!) → Make it clean, simple, and showcase **what you do** and **why you’re the right choice**.
- **Mock Projects** → Build example sites, redesign an existing one for fun, or create something useful.
- **Open-Source & Personal Projects** → Contribute to existing projects, or build a small tool that solves a problem.
- **Strategic Free Work** → Pick **1-2 high-value unpaid projects** that can lead to real referrals or testimonials.

### 🔹 Step 2: Get Your First Clients (Without Feeling Salesy)
You can build on this and get an even stronger portfolio and more experience by getting some first real-world projects! Here are some tips:

- **Start Close to Home** → Ask friends, family, or small businesses you know. They already trust you—easiest yes you’ll get.
- **Target Local Businesses** → Many **still have outdated (or missing) websites**. Find them on **Google Maps**, check their site, and **reach out**.
- **Walk in and Offer Value** → Some businesses won’t respond to emails or DMs, but **face-to-face conversations work wonders**.
- **Leverage Social Media** → Engage in relevant groups, answer questions, and casually mention what you do—no need for hard selling.

#### 💡 Real Example: My First Client
I built a **free website for a local restaurant** I loved. In return?  
✔️ I got my **first real-world project**.  
✔️ They referred me to **paying clients**.  
✔️ Bonus: I still get **free snacks every time I visit**.  
→ **Strategic free work pays off when done right.**

Your goal isn’t to work for free forever—it’s to **build momentum**. Every project completed makes the next one easier.



## 2: Stand Out—Find Your Niche

Once you have a portfolio, the next step is **making sure clients pick you over the competition.**

### ✅ Step 1: Define What Makes You Unique
There are thousands of freelancers—why should someone hire *you*? The key: **specialization**.

- **Generalist = Competing with everyone.**
- **Specialist = Becoming the go-to expert in a specific space.**

Your niche could be (make it specific, these are still kinda broad!):  
✔️ **E-commerce sites** for small shop owners.  
✔️ **Conversion-focused landing pages** for startups.  
✔️ **High-performance websites** for fitness professionals.  
✔️ **SEO-optimized blogs** for content creators.

**For me?** I work with **small businesses & startups** that need high-quality websites **without agency pricing.**  
I even further focussed (in the past, trying to grow this at the moment!) on powerlifting coaches → a super-small niche, but
I could easily become the go-to expert in Germany for these kind of website projects!
I streamline my workflow with a **reliable Jekyll theme**—keeping costs low while ensuring quality.

### 🔹 Step 2: Communicate Your Niche Clearly
Being specialized doesn’t mean turning clients away—it means attracting the **right ones**.

- **Website & Socials** → Make it **clear who you help and how**.
- **Portfolio** → Show projects aligned with your niche.
- **Messaging** → Speak directly to your ideal client’s pain points.

The goal? **Become the obvious choice** for your ideal clients.

Your niche can evolve over time, but the sooner you define it, the easier **getting clients** will be.



## 3: Get Found—SEO for Freelancers

Having a great portfolio is useless if no one **can find you**. That’s where **SEO (Search Engine Optimization)** comes in.

### ✅ Step 1: Make Your Website Search-Friendly
A well-optimized website can bring **organic traffic**—potential clients who find you via Google **without ads**.

- **Use keywords** → What would your ideal clients search for? Make sure those terms appear naturally on your site.
- **Fast loading speed** → No one likes a slow website (Google doesn’t either). Optimize images, use caching, and keep it lightweight.
- **Mobile-friendly design** → More than half of searches happen on mobile—your site *must* work smoothly everywhere.

### 🔹 Step 2: Leverage Backlinks (An Easy SEO Win!)
One of the most **powerful SEO hacks**? **Backlinks**—links from other sites to yours.

Here’s what I do:  
✔️ Add a small **“Created by Per Starke Web Dev”** link in the footer of client websites (with client permission.  
✔️ This tells search engines that **trusted sites** are linking to mine, which boosts rankings.  
✔️ More backlinks = **Better visibility** in Google searches.

💡 **Pro Tip:** Some clients might not want an external link—always ask first. A discreet link in the **imprint** or a “Built by” section can work as a compromise.

SEO takes time, but a **well-optimized site + strong backlinks = more inbound leads** without extra effort.



## 4: Social Media—Use It Smart, Not Hard

Social media can be a **powerful tool** for finding clients—but only if used **strategically** (not as a time-sink).

### ✅ Step 1: Use Social Media as an Extended Portfolio
Potential clients **will look you up**—make sure they find proof of your work.

✔️ Regularly post finished projects (websites, mockups, code snippets).  
✔️ Share **behind-the-scenes insights** (process, before/after, problem-solving).  
✔️ Repurpose **blog posts or case studies** to show expertise.

### 🔹 Step 2: Pick the Right Platforms
Not every platform is worth your time. Focus on where your **ideal clients** are:

- **LinkedIn** → Best for professional networking, tech founders, and corporate clients.
- **Instagram** → Great for creative businesses, coaches, small biz owners.
- **Twitter** → Tech & startup space, quick engagement with industry leaders.
- **Pinterest** → Perfect if your work is **visual-heavy** (UI/UX, branding, e-commerce).

💡 **Pro Tip:** You don’t need to be *everywhere*. Pick **1–2 platforms**, post consistently, and let your **work speak for itself**.

### 🔹 Step 3: Decide How Much Time You Want to Invest
- Just want an **online presence**? → Share projects, make sure your profile looks professional, and move on.
- Want to **actively grow an audience**? → Engage, post regularly, and experiment with content formats.

Either way, **social media should work for you—not consume you.**



## 5: Open Source & Pro Bono Work—A Hidden Client Magnet

Not everything you do needs to be paid work to **bring in paying clients**. Open-source and pro bono projects can:

✅ **Boost your reputation** → Show expertise in a way clients can see.  
✅ **Expand your network** → Get noticed by other professionals and potential clients.  
✅ **Sharpen your skills** → Work on real projects outside client constraints.

### ✅ Step 1: Get Involved in Open Source
If you’re a **developer**, contribute to existing projects or build something useful yourself.
- Fix bugs, add features, or improve documentation.
- Launch a small tool, theme, or framework that solves a real problem.
- Use platforms like **GitHub** to showcase contributions.

For non-tech freelancers:
- Offer free branding mockups, copywriting samples, or business templates.
- Support local nonprofits with design, marketing, or website work.

### 🔹 Step 2: Be Strategic with Pro Bono Work
✔️ Choose **projects that align with your services** (so they attract future paying clients).  
✔️ Set **clear boundaries**  
✔️ Treat it **professionally** to get testimonials and case studies in return.

💡 **My Example:** I built a free tool called [**Homepage Canvas**](https://perstarke-webdev.de/canvas) to help streamline website planning with clients.  
It wasn’t just a fun project—it became a valuable **client communication tool** and led to paid work.

👉 Open-source or pro bono work isn’t about working for free forever—it’s about **working smart to gain visibility, credibility, and connections**.


## 6: Content Marketing—Attract Clients While You Sleep

Creating content isn’t just for influencers—it’s a **game-changer** for freelancers. A well-written blog post, guide, or case study can:

✅ **Position you as an expert** → Show potential clients you know your stuff.  
✅ **Improve your SEO** → More people find you when searching for your services.  
✅ **Work 24/7** → Unlike social media posts, evergreen content keeps bringing in traffic.

### ✅ Step 1: Write for Two Audiences
Your content should speak to **both fellow professionals** (networking & credibility) and **potential clients** (trust & sales).

- **For Developers/Freelancers:** Share deep dives on techniques, trends, or workflow tips.
- **For Clients:** Write about how your services solve their problems, why great web design matters, or what makes a project successful.

### 🔹 Step 2: Publish in the Right Places
✔️ **Your own website** → Always post here first for SEO benefits.  
✔️ **Dev.to, Medium, LinkedIn** → Repurpose content for extra exposure.  
✔️ **Guest posts** → Write for industry sites to expand your reach.

👉 Content marketing isn’t about going viral—it’s about **showing up consistently** so the right people find you at the right time,
and see you know what you're doing.



## 7: The Oldest (and Best) Marketing Strategy—Word of Mouth

Nothing beats **a happy client singing your praises.**

✔️ It’s **free marketing**  
✔️ It builds **instant trust**  
✔️ It brings **higher-quality leads** (clients who already believe in your work)

### ✅ Step 1: Deliver Work People WANT to Recommend

Referrals don’t just happen—you **earn them** by:  
✅ Providing top-notch results  
✅ Being reliable & easy to work with  
✅ Communicating clearly & delivering on time  
✅ Continuously finding ways to [**exceed client expectations**](https://blog.perstarke-webdev.de/posts/website-creation-process) — I call this my **"Make Them Smile" project,** an ongoing commitment to improving my services, collaboration and ensuring every client is more than just satisfied!

### 🔹 Step 2: Make It Easy for Clients to Refer You
Even satisfied clients might not think to refer you unless you **remind them.**
- **Ask directly** → A simple “Know anyone else who needs a site?” works wonders.
- **Set up a referral program** → Offer a small incentive, like a discount or bonus service.
- **Social proof** → Ask for testimonials & encourage clients to share their experiences.

💡 **Pro Tip:** Instead of cash incentives, I offer **free social media promotion** for clients who refer me. Win-win!

👉 The easier you make it for people to recommend you, the more referrals will roll in.
