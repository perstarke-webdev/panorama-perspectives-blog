Balancing productivity and well-being in today's fast-paced world can feel like walking a tightrope. Some people thrive on the hustle, while others recoil at the mere mention of the word "productivity." I used to fall somewhere in between, constantly searching for a way to be productive without sacrificing my happiness and free time.

That’s when I stumbled upon Ali Abdaal and his book "Feel Good Productivity." Ali's definition of productivity — **using your time intentionally to do things that are meaningful and enjoyable, ensuring the process is fulfilling and sustainable** — struck a chord with me.

My journey with Ali’s approach began thanks to my sister (<3), who kept mentioning his videos. Curious, I checked them out and was instantly hooked. During my trip to Australia (I know, I bring that up a lot! :D), I delved deeper into his methods, figuring out how to incorporate them into my own life. The results? I figured out which things matter to me and get me toward where I want to be, got more of those done faster and better, and enjoyed my life way more than before.

For me, Ali's approach is more than just a productivity hack; it’s a way of life. It’s about doing more of what matters to me, aligning my actions with my goals, and having fun along the way. Let me share with you how this method transformed my life and how it can do the same for you.


# What is 'Feel Good Productivity'?

### Definition and Core Principles

'Feel Good Productivity' is all about using your time intentionally to engage in activities that are both meaningful and enjoyable. Ali Abdaal's approach revolves around the idea that productivity shouldn't just be about ticking off tasks on a to-do list. Instead, it's about making sure the process of completing those tasks is fulfilling and sustainable.

At its core, 'Feel Good Productivity' integrates joy, purpose, and efficiency into your daily routines.

### Contrast with Traditional Productivity Approaches

Traditional productivity methods often emphasize efficiency and output, sometimes at the expense of personal well-being and satisfaction. These approaches can lead to burnout, stress, and a feeling of perpetual busyness without true fulfillment. In contrast, 'Feel Good Productivity' encourages a more holistic view. It's not just about getting more done, but about enjoying the journey and ensuring that what you do aligns with your values and goals. This approach values sustainability over sheer output, promoting habits and routines that you can maintain in the long run without sacrificing your mental and emotional health.

### Why It's a Game-Changer

The beauty of 'Feel Good Productivity' lies in its balanced philosophy. By focusing on both the process and the outcome, it transforms productivity from a grind into a gratifying experience. This approach stands out because it acknowledges that productivity is deeply personal and should enhance your quality of life, not detract from it. It’s a game-changer because it shifts the narrative from working harder to working smarter and happier. By prioritizing enjoyment and meaning, 'Feel Good Productivity' makes it easier to stay motivated and engaged, leading to more consistent and sustainable success.




# Key Concepts from 'Feel Good Productivity'

## Energize

#### Play
Making work fun is a cornerstone of 'Feel Good Productivity.' This can be achieved through gamification, identifying your <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"
target="_blank" href="https://nifplay.org/what-is-play/play-personalities/">play personalities</a>, and incorporating elements of joy into your tasks. For instance, I discovered that my play personalities are 'explorer' and 'competitor.' By incorporating these aspects into my work, I find it much more enjoyable. Whether it’s listening to your favorite focus music, enjoying your favorite drinks, or working in environments that make you happy, these elements can transform mundane tasks into exciting adventures.

#### Power
Power in this context isn’t about exerting control over others; it’s about self-empowerment. As Ali puts it, it's the feeling that makes us want to shout from the rooftops, "I can do it!" Building self-efficacy—the belief in your own ability to succeed—can significantly enhance both your performance and your enjoyment of tasks. When you feel capable and confident, everything you do becomes more rewarding.

#### People
Humans are inherently social creatures, and our productivity can be greatly enhanced by leveraging our social connections. Working in teams, meeting friends to recharge, and sharing progress with others can provide motivation and support. Whether it’s collaborating on projects or simply having a friend to discuss your goals with, integrating social elements into your productivity routine can make a big difference.

## Unblock

#### Seek Clarity
Understanding the "why" behind what you do is crucial. Seeking clarity about your purpose and goals can drive your motivation and make your efforts feel more meaningful. When you have a clear vision, it’s easier to stay focused and dedicated.

#### Find Courage
Fear is often the biggest obstacle to productivity. Identifying and naming your fears can be the first step in overcoming them. By acknowledging what holds you back, you can develop strategies to confront and conquer these barriers, making way for progress.

#### Get Started
Starting is often the hardest part. It’s easier to keep moving once you’ve begun. Reducing friction and making the initial steps easier can help you gain momentum. Whether it’s breaking tasks into smaller steps or setting up your environment for success, making it easier to start can help you maintain progress.

## Sustain

#### Conserve
Managing your energy is as important as managing your time. Don’t spread yourself too thin by trying to do everything at once. Prioritize what truly matters and conserve your energy for these tasks. This helps maintain your stamina and focus over the long haul.

#### Recharge
Understanding what truly recharges you is key to sustaining productivity. Often, people spend their downtime on activities like scrolling through social media, which don’t actually make them feel better. For me, activities like going for a walk, dancing to music, playing guitar, meditating, or reading are genuinely recharging. Making time for these activities ensures that I stay energized and motivated.

#### Align
Aligning your work with your values and goals prevents you from feeling drained. When your tasks are in harmony with what you believe in and what you want to achieve, the work feels less like a chore and more like a fulfilling journey. This alignment is crucial for maintaining enthusiasm and commitment.




# How I Apply 'Feel Good Productivity' in My Life

### Align

Understanding and aligning with my values and goals has been a game-changer. For instance, when studying for university, which I genuinely enjoy despite the occasional challenges, knowing that I need certain grades to pursue two semesters abroad in Australia next year keeps me motivated. This same motivation helps me study for the IELTS English test.

For my web development work, I find joy in writing posts because I care deeply about the topics I write about. Additionally, I feel a sense of fulfillment in helping small businesses that I love and that can't afford expensive agencies to thrive online. I also prioritize green sustainable IT in my work, which aligns with my values. Saving money for future travels is another goal that keeps me driven. This alignment of personal enjoyment, professional goals, and larger values makes my work more meaningful and enjoyable.

### Playlist

Music plays a significant role in making my work more enjoyable. I've created a playlist of text-free adventurous music, mainly film scores from Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings, and similar. For tasks requiring extreme focus, I prefer listening to 40hz gamma beats, but for most tasks, this adventurous music makes work feel more like an exciting journey.

### Cocktails

Having great-tasting drinks during work is another way I enhance my productivity. My portafilter coffee machine is a staple, but I also love making alcohol-free cocktails to sip while working or studying. One of my favorites is a mix of orange juice and cold tonic water, with mint and grapefruit pieces as decoration, ice cubes, and a glass straw. It looks amazing, tastes great, and makes work much more enjoyable.

### Schedule Breaks and Recharging Activities

I've identified activities that truly recharge me and make sure to incorporate them into my schedule. This includes reducing activities that don't recharge me, like scrolling through social media, and increasing those that do, like going for walks, dancing to music, playing guitar, meditating, or reading. I even schedule these recharging activities in my time-blocking calendar to ensure I don't neglect them (you can find more about my time-blocking approach in [my post on that](https://blog.perstarke-webdev.de/posts/time-blocking)).

For particularly challenging tasks, such as a difficult programming assignment for university, I mix in tasks I love, like writing a new blog post, to balance the workload and keep myself motivated.

### Play-Personalities

I’ve discovered that my play-personalities are 'competitor' and 'explorer,' which I incorporate into my productivity routine.

#### Explore Different Work Spots

One way I embrace my explorer personality is by trying out different work spots, such as cafes or other unique locations. I also love working while traveling, which adds an element of adventure to my work.

#### Go for Hikes with Specific Goals

For tasks requiring a lot of initial thinking and brainstorming, I often go for hikes and let my mind wander about the task. For example, while creating my blog, I spent a few hours on a hike brainstorming how I wanted to organize and design it.

#### Compete Against Yourself with Challenges and Goals

As a competitor, I love setting goals that have a competitive edge. Whether it's competing against myself from last month on the number of written words or the quality of playing a particular guitar song, these challenges keep me motivated. I even got excited when a professor announced an intermediate graded task set up as a competition during one lecture, which speaks to my competitive spirit (I probably said „heallyeahhhh“ a little bit too loud in that moment :D)



# Tips for Implementing 'Feel Good Productivity'

### Start Small

Implementing 'Feel Good Productivity' doesn't require an overnight overhaul of your life. Begin with small, manageable changes. Identify one or two areas where you can make your tasks more enjoyable and sustainable. This might mean adjusting your workspace, adding music to your routine, or taking regular, short breaks to recharge. Small changes can have a big impact over time, making it easier to stick with new habits and see positive results.

### Ali’s Question

<div class="notice--success center">
"What would this look like if it were fun?"
</div>

A powerful tool I’ve adopted from Ali Abdaal is asking myself "What would this look like if it were fun?“. This simple question can transform mundane tasks into engaging activities. He even has a paper note with this question sticked on his laptop, to remind himself to always ask this question in everything he does.
Whether it’s adding a competitive element, incorporating your favorite music, or making a game out of a challenging task, finding ways to make your work fun can significantly boost your motivation and enjoyment.

### Customization

'Feel Good Productivity' is not a one-size-fits-all approach. It’s important to tailor the principles to fit your lifestyle and personal preferences. Experiment with different strategies and find what works best for you. Maybe you thrive on social interactions and need to incorporate more team-based activities, or perhaps you find peace in solo work with a good playlist in the background. The key is to remain flexible and open to adjusting your methods as you discover what makes you most productive and happy.

By starting small, asking Ali’s question, and customizing the approach to your own life, you can effectively implement 'Feel Good Productivity' and transform your daily routine into something that not only gets results but also brings joy and fulfillment.
