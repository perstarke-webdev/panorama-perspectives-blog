After 9 Semesters of Cognitve Science Bachelor and 2 Semesters of Applied Computer Science Master, 
just a few days ago I had my final oral exam in the BY FAR most difficult subject I ever had
("Advanced Algorithms", if you wanna know :D). 
At first, I was hella anxious about this one, and just wanted to get through, also because it was
the final exam before I went on my way to study abroad in Sydney and live there for over a year.
But I not only managed to pass this exam with a 2.0, all while preparing for it next to
a big study project, building my own business, a part-time employed job, planning for australia,
prepping for a competive sports (powerlifting) competition. I also found a way to make it relaxing and fun.
Sounds impossible? Keep reading - because Ethan Hunt isn't the only one who can get impossible missions done xD

I already knew that using AI tools like ChatGPT was a gamechanger for exam prep - and my most-read blog post so far
deals with exactly that: /posts/chatgpt-for-exam-prep.

But after some research, trial&error and brainstorming, I now found a way to even make it more fun, and allow me to use
my time more efficient, and have more free time during exam period.

I've said this before, but its crucial:

# Key Realizations

Before diving into the methods, it's crucial to understand two things:

1. **Time Investment is Essential**: Using ChatGPT doesn't reduce the amount of time you need to put into studying. It's a tool, not a shortcut.
2. **Accuracy Check**: ChatGPT, like any AI, can make mistakes. Always cross-check the information provided.

ChatGPT is not the only AI model capapble of being used for this nowadays - whether you use ChatGPT, the new DeepSeek which
currently is probably the hottest topic in the IT world, or any other advanced AI / LLM model, it all works.
Just make sure you have a model / version which supports file-attachments and allows for long and many messages.
This probabbly requires a pro version, depending on what you use. Sadly, these companies dont pay me to say this haha,
but I defo recommend getting a paid version to fully utilize this tool, not only but also for exam prep, its 
just necessary to be able to use this nowadays, in almost alld omains of studying and working.
But ai-fanboy-words aside, lets get into the methods!!

--

My method works for both oral and written exams - I have used it for both.
Especially the first of the two parts of the method I'll introduce works for any kind of exam.
The second one too, but it's probably even more useful in oral exams than in written exams, and
also depending on how much or little prep material like mock exams you have.

Step 1:
Create lecture summaries - but fun ones, and for listening!

I use ChatGPT (I'll jsut say ChatGPT as a short for any ai model you wanna use) to create summaries of my lectures.
That's nothging special.
But here's the catches:
1: I create 2-3 versions of summaries (depending on complexity and how hard I find it to understand)
2: I create the summaries in such a way that they are perfect to be LISTENED TO, not read.
Heres more detail:

1: Versions.
For each lecture, i create 2 versions. One serves as a fun overview of the topic of the lecture, and 
is focused on being engaging, fun, memorable, full with vivid examples. 
ChatGPT actually is amazing at thoses, I had tons of moments where I really had to laugh out loud.
The second version is a more structured, formal version. Key point: they cover the same content, so its redundancy in content,
just different style. This helps reinforce the same topic in different ways. The fun one makes it, well, fun,
the formal one is more precise and "lectury".
Potentially, on lectures I struggle the most with (in the advances algorith prep, this
was the case for 18 out of 19 lectures :DD), I create a third summary format,
which consists of questions and ansewres in regards to that lecture.
one question, one concise and easy to grasp answer, and so on, for all topics of the lecture.

Here are some of my favorite laugh out loud moments of summaries I've had:

INSERT EXAMPLES

It's important to very precisely and dettailled explain ChatGPT how you want these summaries to be.
Here is an example prompt that I use to start a new chat for new exam prep

DETAILLED EXAMPLE PROMPT

Then, I sent in the slides of a lecture, use a short re-stating prompt with the most important facts
of how the summaries should be, and say what summary type I want.

EXAMPLE

Note:
You might sometimes re-state the fact that you dont want any latex 
(short explanation of what that is inserted here) in your summaries 
chatgpt is not a fan of remebering this, for some reason (I guess It's just been trained
so much to use Latex in formuilas, variables etc), but in the worst case, stop
the generation of the answer, state this again, and then it usally gets it right.

Then, when one summary is created, I go to a tool that converst text to audio
(I use TTSMAKer, also in the pro version, but there certainly are other tools that work just as well,
I just found this to be the easit and best price), copy the summar I got, and let it convert to audio.

Then, I listen to the audio while reading along the text, 
to get into the topic + to check if there are any things I potentially wanna change about the summary

I quickly couble-check all information

and if all is good, I creat the next summary, new type of sam electure or new lecture.

Remember to store the audio files on your desktoip in a formatted way, give them good names
(I usually use subject_lectureNr_summaryType, so it looks like advancedAlgos_l12_fun, or advanceddAlgos_l08_QnA)

After a session of a few lectures, I then send the summaries to my phone
either you can use a file transfer
I just use the chat with myself on Whatsapp, I finbd this the easist to send and manange

Now, I am not done there of course, the key part is to actually listen to these.
Make sure to space this out, I for example tried to liten to each summary at least 4 times,
over a course of 4-6 weeks (if you start early enough :DD Else, space it closer. But you probably know that 
starting early is a good idea xD).
The nice part - you can do this in so many siuations where you otherwise "waste" your time -
I listen while in the car hoem form uni, trainning, grocery shopping. I listen to them while going hiking
(which means it actually is studiyng time to go for a nice hike - hellyeah, for me, this is Jackpot!!).
I also listen while cooking (for uncomplated recpies I dont need to focus on).

Having these differnet summary types, espeically the fun one, is gamechanger for me and
listening to them while either driving or even gong for fun hikes saves me so much time, stress and 
the fun summaries of chatgpt always make me smile, even with lectures I realls truggle with or find boring.

Tip: The summaries also work well as a quick rehearsel directly before the exam - go for a long walk, 
get some fersh air whic already is good for before a tressfull exam, and listen to them one last time, 
to get the content freshyl in your mind again, have a nice cup of coffee, take a deapth breath -
and you got this!!

The next step is practice - and depending on your timeframe, you can either do this fully after the recaps,
or mix practice and recaps. That really depebds, I also use different ways here. 

If you hav elots of mock exam,s practice sheets or so on, 
these are excellent to be used!
However, for oral exams that is rarely the caye, and also for written ones it 
happens a lot.
Again, I utilize chatgpt for this.

I recommend (strongly), to use a new Chat for this - having too long chats, with different aspects
of your stuying, can slow down or even confuse the models. Just use a new one.
My favorite way is to do mock exams - and a lot of them.

I start with mock-exams for each lecture separte, to make sure all contents are covered.
I give the model detaileed description of how I want the mock exam to be - and it usaully
does this extremely well, and really models eam situions good.

Note: ChatGPT seems to be trained to motiveate you - which is good, but when askign it to provide
a grade for your mock exam, it can often be too nice. I got an A for exams where I didnt know half of the
ansers xD I then told the model again to rate me fairly and strictly, because this is key for being well prepped,
and then it got it way better and atually priovided mathicng grades.

Here is the promt I used for this purpose, you can use this for yourself and adapt some parts
to match it to your situation.

INSERT PROMPT

After doing some mock exams of varying difficutly for each lecture separete, and
potentially in between clarifying thigns I didnt anwer correctly or didnt get,
I do mock exams for all lectures together.

Again, I use a NEW chat, and a simialr proimt as above:

INSERT PROMPT

Then, usng the same chat for all remaining mock exanms usually results in the model
getting to know what parts you struggle with the most, and 
potentially asking more quesitons in those topics to reinforce them for you, which is great!
It usually aks you if you want that or not, depending on your model and your situation,
you may say yes/no to this, and you might, if you want it, espeically ask for it by adding this to your prompt

INSERT ADDITOIN.

Typing out your answers in detail, instead of just answering in your mind, makes you usually
think clearer and understand + remember it better, so having "forced" yourself to anser writenly to
adhere to the format you specifie din your instructions to the model is a great way 
to get a better grasp and remembering of the concepts.

Note: Sturllig with recall and having to think about sometihng, and even getting it wrong,
actualyl has been shown to IMPROVE your understanding and recall of topics.
So, if you get many things wrong at first, dont despair, but see it as the actually positive th9ing it is,
namely the best way to get better at remembering and undertsanding. Getting things wrong is a crucail part of learning,
and undrestanding this is a  mindset shift that makes a huge differenc ein how you approach your exam prep.

To make it more fun, try the following:
Ahser as many uqesitons as possible with vivid exampels,
and try to make your ansers a bit fun, simnilar to what chatgpt did with the fun summaries
youll be surprised what you can come up with, believe me! And if not, no need to worry,
but just appraoching answering in that way can make it more fun for yourself to think about

Extra bonus: Appraoching the real (oral) exam in a similar way does, in most cases,
actually feel better and the examiner enjoys it, too. That is at least my experiecne, as
long as you still answer correcctly and formal enough, inserting some fun examples or
especially vivid explanations can make not only our exam experience better, but also theirs!
I certainly enjoyed it that I made my examiner laugh out during my exam, and
noting out loud what an amahing example I just used. Go for it, try it out!

--

using these audio summaries, different summary types, and
sing electure + overall mock exams + trying to answer in a vivid, fun way
has made my eaxm preps for a few exam snow a lot better.
I hope it can do the same for you, too!
Let me know how it goes, and lets smoke your next exam - and enjoy the prep.

And let me know your favirite jokes chatgpt puts inside your fun summaries :D
