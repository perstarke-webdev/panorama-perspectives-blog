In today's post, I'm excited to share strategies and tips that have significantly boosted my freelance career. 
These insights are tailored for web developers but are equally beneficial for freelancers across various fields. 
So, whether you're coding websites or do any other freelancing work, stick around for some universal freelance wisdom.

#### Building a Solid Foundation:
We'll start by discussing how to establish a solid foundation for your freelance work. 
This involves setting up **long-term strategies that enhance all other aspects of your business**. 
Think of this as assembling your toolkit before diving into the actual building process. 
In the next post, we'll explore more immediate, short-term tactics for actively securing client engagements.

It's crucial to blend long-term planning with short-term actions, much like maintaining a balanced diet to stay healthy.
I've experimented with numerous client acquisition techniques, 
and in these posts, I'll detail those that have proven to work, not only for me but for many other freelancers as well.

Whether you're new to freelancing or seeking to expand your client base, 
this guide is packed with actionable advice to help you succeed. 
I personally still work on integrating these strategies as good as possible and educate myself more and more,
so I look forward to sharing this journey with you!


## Building a Strong Portfolio

Okay, let's dive deep into the cornerstone of kickstarting your freelance journey — the portfolio, 
aka your references, that means projects that you have done so far and can showcase. 
Your portfolio is what convinces potential clients that you are the real deal, because it shows them the work you do 
and the value that you offer.
The question now is, how do you build one, especially from scratch, when you haven’t done any projects before.

#### The Catch-22 of Freelancing
The catch-22 of freelancing is: 
You need a portfolio to get work, and you need work to build a portfolio. 
But don’t worry, because there are ways around this.

#### Your Professional Website
As a web developer, having your own professional website isn't just recommended; it’s essential. 
It’s the first proof of your skills. 
Think about it:
Would you buy a website from someone who doesn’t have a website, 
or maybe even worse, who has a shitty website? I bet you would not. 
As a web developer, make sure you have a practical, well-designed and professional website that reflects 
your personality as well as professional approach.
This is one of your first impression on any potential client, so make it count. 
And, with your website, you then have a place to show your references, so potential clients 
can get even more proof of the hopefully great work that you do.

<div class="notice--info center">
If you are in any other freelancing business, having a website nowadays is really important as well, 
but probably doesn’t need to be the first thing to care about, but as a web developer, 
this is literally the first thing I would recommend you to get done.

#### Start close to Home
Now, to get more references and build your portfolio, one tip is to **start close to home**. 
Offer to build websites for friends or family if they have anything they do that might profit from a website. 
You might even have done some projects yourself which you can build websites for, 
so for example I build a website about the research I did for my bachelor thesis, which isn’t work for a real client, 
but it still is a reference of work that I did that potential clients can see.  
  
Also, you can offer your service to **local businesses**, at the start **you might even want to do this for free**, 
which will increase the likelihood that they are gonna say yes, 
so that you can get your first project, even if it’s unpaid.
This one is not about getting paid, but about **gaining real-world experience**, 
getting **feedback**, and your **first testimonials, your first reference** you can show to future clients.  
You can approach local small businesses that could benefit from an online presence, 
either ones that don’t have any website yet, or also ones that do have a website 
which is not great yet and should be improved.
Explain the advantages a website or better website could bring them, 
such as increased visibility and sales, but be upfront about your intentions too. 
You’re looking to build your portfolio, yes, but you’re also offering them value—a professional website at a 
fraction of the market cost or even free, in return for feedback and maybe also some shoutouts on social media. 

<div class="notice--danger center">
Finding the right businesses to approach is tricky and takes a bit of practice and time, but it pays off!
For me for example, I had a good shot at the first business I approached and immediately got the job,
but after that, I needed to approach about 15 other businesses before getting another yes. Don't give up!
</div>

<div class="notice--info center">
You can use Google Maps to find local businesses, and then check on Google and Social Media if you
can find any website, and if yes how good that website is.  
Then, either get to them via Social Media or E-Mail, or as an alternative just walk by and go have a chat!
I would <b>not</b> suggest just calling them, because those sales-calls often are annoying and will make them likely to say no.
</div>

<div class="notice--success center">
Oh and also, each client, whether it is a friend’s startup or a local cafe, 
is a potential source of <b>future referrals</b>. 
Delivering value and building a good relationship can turn a free project into a source of paid referrals 
further down the line, we’ll closer look into referrals at the end of this post.
</div>

Remember, the goal at this stage is to **build a diverse and impactful 
portfolio that showcases your skills** and your ability to deliver results.
Every project you add is one step closer to establishing yourself as a trusted and skilled freelancer 
in the area of your work. So, really **focus on embracing these early opportunities** because 
they are your foundation for the future.

I remember that my first non-family client was a small local restaurant we’re I’ve been snacking quite a few times, 
and I just went to them and offered to build a website for them, 
for free, and they were really happy about the offer. It was a great practice for me, 
I learned a lot of things about working with „real“ clients, 
I actually also get free food there now so every time I walk by I can just grab some delicious snacks and 
I really really love that :D, and they were so happy with the final result that over time they referred 
me on to a few other paying clients, so it clearly was a win-win and a great start.  
This clearly shows how you can also profit from something like that.
