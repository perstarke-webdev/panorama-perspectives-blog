<h1>Introduction Post: Welcome to Panorama Perspectives</h1>

Hey there, and a big welcome to everyone tuning in! It’s great to have you here as we kick off this blog.
I’m diving straight into what this blog will be about,
covering a range of topics I’m really into.
The idea behind Panorama Perspectives is pretty straightforward -
to explore a bunch of different subjects like freelancing, web development / IT, traveling,
productivity, personal development, competitive sports and more, and offer you some cool and helpful insights.
I’ve really put my heart and soul into learning about these topics, applying the things
I’ve learned while still being open to always learn more, and from that perspective
I want to use the time and effort that I have put into educating myself within these topics to
provide you with as many valuable insights as possible.
That is basically also where the name Panorama Perspectives comes from,
with that name I want to express the diverse topics and the unique and broad, panoramic, perspectives
that I want to offer you.

<h3>A Look at Why We're Here:</h3>
The reason I’m talking about so many different things is simply because these are areas I’m super interested in.
I’ve spent a lot of time learning about them, trying things out,
and I’m still keen on learning more.
Through this blog, I’m hoping to pass on some of that knowledge and insight to you all.

<h3>I’m All Ears for Your Thoughts:</h3>
I’m genuinely excited to hear from you  -
whether it’s something you liked, something you didn’t, or just your thoughts in general.
Feedback is gold, and I’m here for all of it.
It helps me understand what works, what doesn’t, and how I can make this blog even better for you.

Also always feel free to name me any specific topic or question you'd love a post about!

<h3>So, Who’s Per?</h3>
Alright, let’s get into a bit about me, because it’ll give you an idea of what to expect from this blog.
I’m Per, I did my bachelor's in Cognitive Science and now I’m doing my master's in Applied Computer Science.
On the side, I work in a digital research &  development department focusing on AI and Data Science,
and I do freelance web development too.
<br><br>
Outside of work and study, I’m really into competitive strength sports (powerlifting, to be precise),
I follow a vegan lifestyle, and yeah,
I have a speech defect (stuttering), which is something I plan to talk more about in future posts,
like how to deal with stuff like that.
Traveling is another big love of mine - I recently spent 8 weeks in Australia, which was an amazing experience.
And lately, I’ve been getting really deep into personal growth, productivity,
and all that good stuff about making life better and more fulfilling.

<h3>What’s Coming Up:</h3>
This blog is going to cover topics ranging from freelancing and web development (or some more general computer science),
how to use AI tools in everyday life, to competitive sports and tips for living a healthier, more productive life.
I’ll share some personal stories, like dealing with a speech defect, and talk about traveling,
especially how you can work remotely while exploring new places.
<br><br>
And that’s pretty much the intro to what Panorama Perspectives is all about.
I’m pumped to start this journey with you and share everything I’ve learned along the way.
Your support means a lot to me, and I can’t wait to dive into these topics together.
<br><br>
Stick around for more posts where we’ll get into the nitty-gritty of these subjects.
Here’s to us learning, sharing, and growing together.
Thanks a bunch for being here, and I’m looking forward to an awesome ride ahead.
