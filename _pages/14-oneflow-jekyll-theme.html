<h1>What it is</h1>

OneFlow is a Jekyll Theme designed to create <b class="light-color">stunning, clear and practical modern One-Pager Websites</b>.
It offers lots of features and customization options, so you can easily create a Site that
matches your own or your client's wishes for design and structure.
<br><br>
It offers <b class="light-color">various customization options</b>, like a sticky or non-sticky navigation bar and several diverse color skins.
Furthermore, OneFlow comes with lots of build-in utilities like
buttons, boxes, notices, galleries, round-images and image-text-rows.
You can apply sections with alternating background color and can fuss-freely use a background image.
<br><br>
It is <b class="light-color">straightforward and easy to use</b>. You just need to clone the
<a href="https://github.com/perstarke-webdev/oneflow-jekyll-theme"
   rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">
    GitHub Repository and can get started straightaway.

<h1>Getting started & development</h1>

<h3>Fork and clone the repository</h3>
The <b class="light-color">vision of this theme</b> is <b class="light-color">simplicity and accessibility</b>, to easily create stunning websites from scratch.
Therefore, it's not available as a classic gem-based Jekyll theme, but as a ready-to-use GitHub repository that you just need to fork and clone.
So, get ahead and make a fork of this repository, rename it if you like to suit the name of the site you want to create, locally clone it, and directly start editing!

<h3>How to start a development docker container</h3>
To test your website and see all of your changes in real-time without deploying it online, you can easily build your site locally.
OneFlow comes with build-in docker configuration using
<a href="https://github.com/BretFisher/jekyll-serve" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">BretFisher's jekyll serve</a>.
<ul>
    <li>Make sure you have <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://bundler.io/">Bundler</a>
        and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> installed</li>
    <li>Open up a terminal, navigate to your local repository, and run <code>docker compose up</code>.</li>
</ul>
Your site will then be visible at <i>http://0.0.0.0:4000/</i> in any browser.

<h1>Start editing your Site</h1>

<ul>
    <li><code>README.md</code> for the readme of your repository,</li>
    <li><code>/_data/navigation.yml</code> for the navigation links,</li>
    <li><code>/_pages/index.html</code> for your main content,</li>
    <li><code>/_pages/imprint.html</code> for the imprint & privacy note,</li>
    <li><code>_config.yml</code> for the basic setup of your site,</li>
    <li><code>/assets/images</code> for all images and graphics you use on your site,</li>
    <li><code>/assets/css/custom-styles.css</code> if you want to add custom css styles,</li>
    <li><code>/assets/fonts</code> if you want to add custom fonts and</li>
    <li><code>/_includes/editables</code>
        if you create a website for a client who regularly wants to change parts of the site him/herself.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Color skins</h2>

OneFlow comes with 10 diverse color skins you can easily apply.
These are: <i>default</i>, <i>air</i>, <i>aqua</i>, <i>contrast</i>, <i>dark</i>, <i>dirt</i>, <i>neon</i>, <i>mint</i>, <i>plum</i> and <i>sunrise</i>.
Check the <a href="https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes?tab=readme-ov-file#skins-color-variations" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Minimal Mistakes documentation about color skins</a> for example images.
To change color skins, open <code>config.yml</code> and look for <code>oneflow-skin</code>. Set your preferred skin there.

<h2>Masthead</h2>
The Masthead, including the navigation bar, offers a few customization options.
All of this configuration can be done in <code>config.yml</code>.<br><br>
First, you can decide whether you like it to be <b class="light-color">sticky</b>, meaning it will stay visible on top of the page even
when you scroll down, or not.
To make the masthead sticky, set <code>sticky-masthead: true</code>.<br><br>
You can furthermore easily set the opacity of the masthead with <code>masthead-opacity: xxx</code>, where xxx is
a number between 0 and 1. A good starting point that works good for most sites is 0.8 to 0.9.
