<h1>What it is</h1>

OneFlow is a Jekyll Theme designed to create <b class="light-color">stunning, clear and practical modern One-Pager Websites</b>.
It offers lots of features and customization options, so you can easily create a Site that
matches your own or your client's wishes for design and structure.
<br><br>
It offers <b class="light-color">various customization options</b>, like a sticky or non-sticky navigation bar and several diverse color skins.
Furthermore, OneFlow comes with lots of build-in utilities like
buttons, boxes, notices, galleries, round-images and image-text-rows.
You can apply sections with alternating background color and can fuss-freely use a background image.
<br><br>
It is <b class="light-color">straightforward and easy to use</b>. You just need to clone the
<a href="https://github.com/perstarke-webdev/oneflow-jekyll-theme"
   rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">
    GitHub Repository and can get started straightaway.
</a>


<hr class="big-sep">


<h1>Getting started & development</h1>

<h3>Fork and clone the repository</h3>
The <b class="light-color">vision of this theme</b> is <b class="light-color">simplicity and accessibility</b>, to easily create stunning websites from scratch.
Therefore, it's not available as a classic gem-based Jekyll theme, but as a ready-to-use GitHub repository that you just need to fork and clone.
So, get ahead and make a fork of this repository, rename it if you like to suit the name of the site you want to create, locally clone it, and directly start editing!

<h3>How to start a development docker container</h3>
To test your website and see all of your changes in real-time without deploying it online, you can easily build your site locally.
OneFlow comes with build-in docker configuration using
<a href="https://github.com/BretFisher/jekyll-serve" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">BretFisher's jekyll serve</a>.
<ul>
    <li>Make sure you have <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://bundler.io/">Bundler</a>
        and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> installed</li>
    <li>Open up a terminal, navigate to your local repository, and run <code>docker compose up</code>.</li>
</ul>
Your site will then be visible at <i>http://0.0.0.0:4000/</i> in any browser.


<hr class="big-sep">

<h1>Markdown and HTML</h1>
Use raw and flexible HTML or clear markdown to write your content.
Markdown is rendered with <a href="https://kramdown.gettalong.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">kramdown</a>,
which supports applying css classes to the Markdown. That means, you can add notices, boxes and other utilities even to your Markdown content,
as simple as <code>"Text you want to add the classes to {: .class1 .class2}"</code>.
This documentation will show everything in HTML, but as shown in the lines above, applying css classes is also easily possible with Markdown.


<hr class="big-sep">

<h1>Responsive Design</h1>
All of OneFlows features are 100% responsive and adapt to different screen sizes, so your site looks good
on all devices!

<h1>Start editing your Site</h1>
The main parts you want to edit are:
<ul>
    <li><code>README.md</code> for the readme of your repository,</li>
    <li><code>/_data/navigation.yml</code> for the navigation links,</li>
    <li><code>/_pages/index.html</code> for your main content,</li>
    <li><code>/_pages/imprint.html</code> for the imprint & privacy note,</li>
    <li><code>_config.yml</code> for the basic setup of your site,</li>
    <li><code>/assets/images</code> for all images and graphics you use on your site,</li>
    <li><code>/assets/css/custom-styles.css</code> if you want to add custom css styles,</li>
    <li><code>/assets/fonts</code> if you want to add custom fonts and</li>
    <li><code>/_includes/editables</code>
        if you create a website for a client who regularly wants to change parts of the site him/herself.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Color skins</h2>

OneFlow comes with 10 diverse color skins you can easily apply.
These are: <i>default</i>, <i>air</i>, <i>aqua</i>, <i>contrast</i>, <i>dark</i>, <i>dirt</i>, <i>neon</i>, <i>mint</i>, <i>plum</i> and <i>sunrise</i>.
Check the <a href="https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes?tab=readme-ov-file#skins-color-variations" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Minimal Mistakes documentation about color skins</a> for example images.
Define your preferred skin by changing the value of <code>oneflow-skin</code> in <code>_config.yml.</code>.

<h2>Masthead</h2>
The Masthead, including the navigation bar, offers a few customization options.
All of this configuration can be done in <code>config.yml</code>.<br><br>
First, you can decide whether you like it to be <b class="light-color">sticky</b>, meaning it will stay visible on top of the page even
when you scroll down, or not.
To make the masthead sticky, set <code>sticky-masthead: true</code>.
<br><br>
You can furthermore easily set the <b class="light-color">opacity</b> of the masthead with <code>masthead-opacity: xxx</code>, where xxx is
a number between 0 and 1. A good starting point that works good for most sites is 0.8 to 0.9.
<br><br>
The masthead can either contain a <b class="light-color">logo (or any other image)</b>, or your site title and optionally a sub-title.
If you want to display your logo / image there, set <code>logo: /assets/images/logo.webp</code> or the respective
path to the image and filetype you want to use.
If you don't want your logo / image there, remove the logo path or out-comment it by setting <code>#</code> behind the <code>:</code> like so:
<code> logo: #/assets/...</code>.
By default, the site title, which is also shown in the browser tab, is then displayed instead of the logo.
You can set the title by setting <code>title: "your-website-title"</code>.
Set the subtitle with <code>subtitle: "your-subtitle"</code> or set this to <code>""</code> to have no subtitle.
If you want to display a different title than your default site title in the masthead, you can set this with
<code>masthead_title: "your-masthead-title"</code>. Set this to <code>""</code> to display no title.

<h2>Background</h2>
As the background for your site, you can either stick with the background colors that come with your chosen color skin,
or you can apply a <b class="light-color">background image</b> instead.
Background image settings are all done in <code>config.yml</code>.
Set <code>background-image: "/path/to/your/background-image.webp"</code>. To have no background-image, remove or out-comment this line.
When working with a background image, it is strongly recommended to use a horizontal background image for the desktop
version of your site and an upright image for the mobile version. You can easily do this, by using a horizontal
image for <code>background-image</code>, and setting a different image (or different version of the same image) for
<code>background-image-mobile</code>. Furthermore, it is also strongly recommended to apply a slightly transparent
overlay to the background image, for better readability of all texts on your site. You can set this
by setting <code>background-image-overlay : rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)</code> or any other rgba color value you like.

<h2>Popup</h2>
As some countries, like Germany, require <b class="light-color">information and consent about cookie-usage</b> and the usage of a CDN
for example for deploying sites on GitHub pages, OneFlow comes with a build-in Popup for that purpose.
You can enable or disable the Popup in <code>config.yml</code> with true/false for <code>show-popup</code>.
Do not use quotation marks for setting true/false values in the configuration file.
<br><br>
The existing version of the popup is a suggestion and should (no legal advice given) fulfill german laws regarding cookie and cdn-usage consent.
<br><br>
To edit the content of the popup, navigate to <code>/_includes/popup.html</code> and edit its HTML.
This file also contains a script-tag with the javascript for the popup. This script sets a cookie for one day,
when the user clicks on the "Agree"-button, so the popup is not displayed on every page reload, but only after one day.
Edit the line <code>expiresDate.setDate(expiresDate.getDate() + 1);</code> to set this to a different time interval.

<h2>Content & Basic home page setup</h2>
To start adding content to your main page, navigate to <code>/_pages/index.html</code>.
Remove the example content, and start adding your own!
<br><br>
First, you need to set some basics in the YAML front matter.
So, start with:<br>
<code>
    ---<br>
    layout: page<br>
    title: "The Title That Should Display In Your Page Hero"<br>
    excerpt: "The Sub-Title Below Your Main Title"<br>
    permalink: /<br>
    ---
</code><br><br>
You can furthermore customize the <b class="light-color">Page Hero</b>, which is the first thing catching the visitors eyes!
The Page Hero can include:
<ul>
    <li>A title</li>
    <li>A subtitle</li>
    <li>An image</li>
    <li>An image overlay</li>
    <li>A caption</li>
    <li>Action buttons</li>
</ul>
Set and customize them like so:<br>
<code>
    header:
    overlay_image: /assets/images/header.webp
    overlay_filter: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6)

    actions:
    - label: "Get Started"
    url: https://github.com/perstarke-webdev/oneflow-jekyll-theme?tab=readme-ov-file#oneflow-jekyll-theme
    blank: true
    - label: "Minimal Mistakes, the base for this theme"
    url: https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes
    blank: true
