<h1>What it is</h1>

OneFlow is a Jekyll Theme designed to create <b class="light-color">stunning, clear and practical modern One-Pager Websites</b>.
It offers lots of features and customization options, so you can easily create a Site that
matches your own or your client's wishes for design and structure.
<br><br>
It offers <b class="light-color">various customization options</b>, like a sticky or non-sticky navigation bar and several diverse color skins.
Furthermore, OneFlow comes with lots of build-in utilities like
buttons, boxes, notices, galleries, round-images and image-text-rows.
You can apply sections with alternating background color and can fuss-freely use a background image.
<br><br>
It is <b class="light-color">straightforward and easy to use</b>. You just need to clone the
<a href="https://github.com/perstarke-webdev/oneflow-jekyll-theme"

<h1>Getting started & development</h1>

<h3>Fork and clone the repository</h3>
The <b class="light-color">vision of this theme</b> is <b class="light-color">simplicity and accessibility</b>, to easily create stunning websites from scratch.
Therefore, it's not available as a classic gem-based Jekyll theme, but as a ready-to-use GitHub repository that you just need to fork and clone.
So, get ahead and make a fork of this repository, rename it if you like to suit the name of the site you want to create, locally clone it, and directly start editing!

<h3>How to start a development docker container</h3>
To test your website and see all of your changes in real-time without deploying it online, you can easily build your site locally.
OneFlow comes with build-in docker configuration using
<a href="https://github.com/BretFisher/jekyll-serve" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">BretFisher's jekyll serve</a>.
<ul>
    <li>Make sure you have <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://bundler.io/">Bundler</a>
        and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> installed</li>
    <li>Open up a terminal, navigate to your local repository, and run <code>docker compose up</code>.</li>
</ul>
Your site will then be visible at <i>http://0.0.0.0:4000/</i> in any browser.
