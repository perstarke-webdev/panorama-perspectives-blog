Join me on the journey of crafting OneFlow, a Jekyll theme designed for seamless One-Pager websites. Why did I choose a GitHub repository over the conventional official theme route? The answer is as straightforward as OneFlow's structure. Let's delve into the code and explore why this laid-back approach aligns with my vision.

# Vision
OneFlow is the result of a vision to simplify the process of creating One-Pager websites. It's all about ease and efficiency, from installation to customization. This theme is perfect for individuals and small businesses who want a beautiful online presence without the headache of complex website building.

# Development
## Starting Point
My starting point was the Minimal Mistakes theme. From there, I copied the theme repository and meticulously removed everything I didn't need. This left me with the bare essentials, allowing me to build OneFlow from the ground up.

## Adding Essential Tools
I added a few essential tools to make the development process smoother. This included:

_manage-site.sh: A shell script to locally build and test the site.
Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml: To streamline the deployment process using Docker.
Gemfile: Updated to include the necessary gems.
gitignore: To ensure irrelevant files aren't included in the repository.

## Core Structure
The core structure of OneFlow includes:

_config.yml: For site configuration.
_data: To store data files.
_includes: For reusable HTML fragments.
_layouts: For different page layouts.
_sass: For Sass partials.
assets: For images, fonts, and other assets.
index.html: The homepage.
minimal-mistakes-jekyll.gemspec: Gemspec file.
package.json: For NPM packages.
README.md: Documentation.


## Style Changes and Adding Functionality

OneFlow comes with a range of style changes and additional functionality to make your One-Pager website stand out:

Centralized Text and Elements: Most elements are centered for a clean and uniform appearance.
Larger Logo in Masthead: For better visibility and branding.
Customizable Page Hero: An image covering the full screen with the option to set masthead opacity and transparency.
Customizable Footer: Easily update footer styles and auto-create footer content from the config file.
Alternating Section Colors: Add stylish section separators and alternating color sections for a modern look.
Customized Gallery: No media queries mean your gallery layout stays consistent on different screen sizes.
Image-Text Rows: Create visually appealing content with text and images side by side.
Editables and Background Images: Make updates and set background images easily with no coding required.
Font Awesome Icons: Locally host Font Awesome icons for consistent and fast loading.
Cookie Consent Popup: For legal compliance and a seamless user experience.
OneFlow is a versatile and user-friendly theme that puts you in control of your One-Pager website. With its intuitive structure and customizable features, you can create a stunning online presence with ease.
